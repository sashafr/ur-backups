Instead, Woolley's main goal was to uncover the best preserved floorplans of houses. These he found several meters down, houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. Because the Old Babylonian period was typically that associated with the potential time of Abraham, Woolley used the abbreviation AH (Abraham's Housing) to refer to this excavation area.\r\n\r\nIn the course of excavation of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian levels Woolley numbered 27 'houses,' or excavation units. He renumbered the houses for publication based on the overall plan, preserved walls, and doors onto streets. In this way he showed there were 52 individual houses within his 27 excavation areas. However, houses were frequently altered throughout period, as families would knock out walls or block up doors, and thus true house numbers are difficult to establish. Woolley mentions phases of rebuilding, but states that he sought the best preserved floor plan and published the excavation of a particular house based on that plan alone. In some cases he noted deeper remains that may have gone back to the Ur III period. These levels he partially uncovered as he excavated graves beneath the Larsa period floors.\r\n\r\nA great deal of baked brick was in use for walls of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. Some houses used it in the lowest portion of a wall, but others used it for entire walls up to 3 meters in height. Town planning was not evident, as streets tended to wander in narrow and winding paths. Corners where streets met were often rounded, leading Woolley to surmise that this was to prevent problems with laden donkeys catching their wares on corners.\r\n\r\nMany houses had a domestic chapel within, often with family burials beneath the floor. Communal chapels were also noted, at least four being identified in the area. Finally, Woolley believed that some buildings were specifically used for commercial activities (shops), though this is difficult to prove.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":996,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/996/","title":"Baker's Square","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Baker's Square","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Baker's Square","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"This square is located to the South West of AH.

Everything that had been in the building at the moment of its destruction had been preserved in situ. The NE wall stood from ten to seventeen courses high - where it was most ruined the water-laid strata ran over the top of it, showing that there was no rebuilding; the SW wall stood to seven courses, the NW also to seven; the floor was brick-paved, but in the west corner the pavement stopped short at 0.54 m. from the NW wall, and at 1.00 m. from the SW wall, and from the face of that wall three or four bricks projected by as much as 0.15 m., showing that there had been here some kind of pedestal whose front was presumably flush with that of the bases flanking the doorway, though the latter were not bonded into the wall, as whatever stood here in the corner must have been. In the NW wall were two doors, one leading to the passage, Room 5, the other, distinguished by reveals to its jambs, opening on the sanctuary. Against either jamb was a base or pedestal built of mud brick over burnt brick foundations, 0.54 m. sq. X 0.65 m. and 0.75 m. high respectively; in the top of the SW pedestal was a rectangular hollow 0.40 m. X 0.20 m. X 0.20 m. deep, lined with bitumen; the top of the other was flat. In front of the door stood a brick altar 0.75 m. X 0.50 m. X 0.75 m. high with traces of bitumen on its top. In the east corner there was a rectangle of burnt bricks about 1.00 m. X 1.10 m. raised 0.15 above the level of the pavement; if there had been mud brick above this it had disappeared, but that there had been such was not unlikely, and the top of the existing brickwork was rough and unlike a true surface. Against the NE wall, at 1.20 m. from the east corner of the court, there was a gap in the pavement 1.40 m. long and 0.65 m. wide; this may have been due simply to the disappearance of some of the paving-bricks, but was possibly the site of some construction in mud or mud brick, possibly a base.","inline_note":"","footnote":"UE 7 p.126"}]},{"id":269,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/269/","title":"Room 3","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Room 3","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Room 3","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Room 3 was brick-paved and on the same level as the court; its door had originally been wider but had been narrowed by the addition of a jamb against the SW wall and, apparently at the same time, an extra jamb had been built against the end of the NW wall reducing the entrance to less than 0.60 m.; in its present form it is a cupboard rather than a room.

The chapel faced on a small open space and commanded a view down Paternoster Row (P1. 19b); it lay high and a flight of brick steps led up to a threshold 0.65 m. above street level, and this was shown to be its original height by the fact that the jambs of the door-opening did not go down below the threshold whereas in most of the neighbouring houses the door openings went down well below street level although added thresholds may have raised that opening by 0.50 m. or even by 1.00 m.; alongside the chapel a similar flight of steps led from Paternoster Row to Bazaar Alley, the level of which was the same as that of the chapel pavement. The chapel then was built at a time when the street level was that shown in our photograph, a level acquired only after most of the houses bordering the street had been standing for some while; it stood so high above the street that no reconstruction to meet a rise in level was necessary during the lifetime of the quarter; this height was obtained by the demolition of the south part of No. 14, and the chapel walls were newly built ad hoc, the burnt brick in them rising nine and on the SE side twelve courses above that in the older house walls.","inline_note":"","footnote":"UE 7 p.154"}]},{"id":70,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/70/","title":"No. 1 Paternoster Row","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"No. 1 Paternoster Row","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"No. 1 Paternoster Row","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"The Nin-subur Chapel","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Carfax Chapel","inline_note":"","footnote":"Antiquaries Journal 11 (1931) "},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Amar Chapel","inline_note":"","footnote":"Woolley's object card U.18837"},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Chapel of the Seated Goddess","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"The small triangular building stood at the junction of Paternoster Row and Store Street, facing on Carfax; it consisted only of an entrance court and a sanctuary; the name of the goddess to whom it was dedicated was given by an inscribed limestone mace-head (U.18837, P1. 58b) found just inside the door. The building had been twice rebuilt after its original foundation and had undergone minor alterations as well.\r\nThe original building had a rounded corner made with specially moulded bricks; on Paternoster Row there was an offset of 0.08 m., on Store Street the foundations and the face of the wall proper were flush; of it only three courses of burnt brick remained. On these, as a foundation, was built the second version of the chapel; on Paternoster Row it started flush with the old wall, but ran crooked and soon fell back from its line, on Store Street it had a set-back of 0.10 m. throughout its length. Its corner instead of being rounded was taken off by a hollow reveal. On Paternoster Row there was a doorway 0.90 m. wide at 3.25 m. from the comer with its threshold three courses above the offset of the old wall; on Store Street there was another at the same level also 0.90 m. wide at 3.80 m. from the corner.  In its latest form the chapel was divided into three parts by a cross-wall running NW X SE which cut off the base of the triangle and by a wall at right angles to this which divided the base or SW end into two. The triangular entrance-court was paved with bricks 0.23 m.

Owing to its size and complication we gave it the name \"The Khan\", being unprepared to find a private house with nineteen or more ground-floor rooms; but it must be admitted that the presence at the back of the building of a large domestic chapel with many burials is against such an identification and this may have been merely the home of a wealthier citizen than the others living in the quarter and may be not less typical of its class than are the more modest houses of theirs.

On the inside of the street wall there was an offset corresponding to the early threshold and in Room 8 there were remains of brick pavement at this level; in the same room, and in Room 1 and elsewhere, the existing pavement was 0.40 m. above the offset and so corresponded with the first raising of the front-door threshold. The internal walls had their foundations on the offset level, but some of them were re-built over older mud-brick walls following the same lines; the east (outer) wall had burnt brick foundations going down 0.80 m. lower and resting on mud brick and the west wall went down for 0.90 m. with mud brick below, while the street wall went down in burnt brick 1.20 m. below the door threshold. That the mud brick below the walls was not contemporary foundation is shown by the fact that its top was not flat and regular, but broken, so that the burnt brick above had had to be stepped down at intervals to secure a proper footing in the gaps. It follows therefore that the house as it has survived was a reconstruction of an older building of a more or less similar design, but that older building was of definitely earlier date than the quarter in general (i.e., of the Third Dynasty rather than of the Larsa period) and the lack of any front door in its wall on Store Street implies a different orientation if not an altered street line.

On the tops of some of the Larsa walls there were flimsy remains of burnt-brick walls of the Kassite period, and much of the Larsa brick-work had been torn down and levelled to make an even foundation for the walls of the Kassite house. On the other hand much of the evidence suggests that this house dated back to an ancient foundation in Third Dynasty times. The burnt-brick walls of the Larsa period followed along the lines of an older mud-brick structure, and between the pavement associated with this older building and that of the end of the Larsa period, there was an accumulation of more than 1.6 metres of debris. The rubbish in the courtyard underneath the late Larsa pavement consisted of decayed mud brick and contained carinated saucers of Third Dynasty type. In the SW wall there was an inscribed brick of Amar-Suena, but the fact that this wall did not go as deep as the boundary wall of No. 4 Paternoster Row and that the foundations of No. 4 Straight Street appeared to overlap the burnt-brick work of No. 4 Paternoster Row indicates that the latter was an earlier foundation still.","inline_note":"","footnote":"p. 161-2"},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"The brickwork and pavements in this room give a convenient summary of the history of this house which divides itself into four main periods: 1.

Some references to it state that it is the central portion of the northeastern city wall, thus it might mean Central Long Wall. Field notes with the abbreviation, however, refer to excavation squares along the entirety of the edge of the mound where the outer city wall once stood and thus it more likely to refer to the City Long Wall as a whole.\r\n\r\nH.R. Hall dug a 12 meter trench across the city wall in 1919, but Woolley began his investigations of it in February of 1929. In a period of a few days he exposed 100 meters of the length of the wall behind his dig house. In the next season he set his workers to tracing the entirety of the wall, which ran approximately 2.5 miles around the city. To uncover it they simply followed the outer line of the wall to no great depth and made cross cut trenches to assess the width of the wall at intervals. Despite the great extent, the tracing of the wall took only one month. In a report sent from the field in February of 1930, Woolley said, \"...the wall is a complete ruin; not a vestige of the burnt-brick wall proper has been discovered and in few places does more survive than the weathered stump of the huge mud-brick rampart along which the wall originally ran.\"\r\n\r\nThe investigations showed the original wall to be between 25 and 34 meters wide and Woolley estimated that it once stood to a height of 8 meters. On the central portion of the east side, he found and excavated partial houses. Woolley believed that for portions of Ur's history, the backs of these houses formed the defensive wall itself. Many of the objects marked as CLW come from this specific area of houses along the wall, and this is likely the reason that CLW in abbreviation lists is said to be the central portion of the northeast city wall.\r\n\r\nThe sloping revetment that was often found in CLW squares was evidence of the bank of a canal running along the east side of the city. Some of the CLW squares also contained other excavation areas, such as the North and West harbors, the so-called Kassite Fort, the Rim Sin temple (RS), and the Nin-Ezen Temple (NT).","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4372,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4372/","title":"CLW Graves","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLW Graves","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Graves located somwehere in CLW, that do not have a period designation","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":1873,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1873/","title":"CLWG/10","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/10","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 10","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3387,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3387/","title":"CLWG/101","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/101","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 101","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3395,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3395/","title":"CLWG/125","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/125","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 125","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":1862,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1862/","title":"CLWG/129","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/129","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 129","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":1871,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1871/","title":"CLWG/24","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/24","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 24","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3402,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3402/","title":"CLWG/81","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"CLWG/81","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4373,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4373/","title":"Kassite Graves","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Kassite Graves","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3399,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3399/","title":"KG/76 | CLWG/76","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"KG/76 | CLWG/76","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave 76","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Kassite Grave 76","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4374,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4374/","title":"Larsa Graves","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Larsa Graves","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":836,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/836/","title":"LG/166 | CLWG/A","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"LG/166 | CLWG/A","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"CLW Grave A","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Larsa Grave 166","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"In a corner of a Larsa chamber on Town\r\nwall.","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Burial Type","property_value":"Larnax F. 0.70m. x 0.22m.

The temple nearest the surface was that built in the Neo-Babylonian period and attributable to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. The excavation area abbreviation NT actually stands for Nebuchadnezzar's temple. No Persian period temple was found here but Persian burials infringed on the building (see area NTB).\r\n\r\nBeneath the Neo-Babylonian temple Woolley discovered another, similar temple of the Kassite period. This one seemed to have two phases of construction, one phase attributable to the reign of Kurigalzu. Beneath this sat another temple of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period, also with two phases. One of these dated to the reign of Rim Sin and the other to that of Sin-Iddinam. Yet another temple sat beneath, but this one was very fragmentary and difficult to map. It likely belonged to the Ur III period but little could be discerned.\r\n\r\nInscribed clay cones found in the Larsa levels give the name of the building as E-ni-gi-na and state that Rim-Sin restored this temple dedicated to Nin-gish-zida. Inscriptions in other levels show that this deity was honored here throughout the time periods but that Nin-Ezen (Ningizzida's consort) was also honored here in a kind of double shrine. Woolley suggested that another temple to Nin-Ezen appeared in the temenos area (see area SM) and that Ningizzida was the primary deity for this smaller temple in the southern

When he found cylinders inscribed with the name of Shulgi beneath a partly ruined floor (excavation area abbreviation DT in the northwestern portion of area EH), he thought he might have found it or at least indications of it. This building turned out to be a temple dedicated to Dimtabba (now read Nimintabba) and its very partial remains extended beyond the line of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall to the west. Woolley continued to dig into this western area under a new excavation abbreviation, DP. This area did not reveal a palace or additional ruins of the Nimintabba temple, but instead it showed denuded domestic space related to Hall's Area A excavations.

It expanded into a larger building in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. It had multiple functions, religious and administrative, through the centuries. An inscribed door socket of Amar-Sin found here refers to the building as the great storehouse of tablets and the place of judgment. It was thus essentially a law court, possibly with tablets recording judgments stored within. In Mesopotamia, an eastern gateway--in sight of the rising sun--was typically seen as a place of justice, and gateways were often places where witnesses or judges might hear claims.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ur III period the door onto the ziggurat terrace was sealed up and the dublalmah appears to have become a shrine, but it retained its name and probably its law court function. Kurigalzu made significant restorations to the building in the Kassite period and Woolley marveled at the well-constructed fully preserved arched doorway of this Late Bronze Age time. By the Neo-Babylonian period, the structure had essentially merged with the functions of the neighboring giparu.","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Culture/Period","property_value":"EDIII; UrIII; OB; Kassite; NB","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Season Number","property_value":"3; 6","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4343,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4343/","title":"Room 6","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Room 6","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Room 6","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3618,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3618/","title":"Unit 13","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Unit 13","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Unit 13, LL","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3615,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3615/","title":"Unit 4","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Unit 4","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Unit 4 of LL","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3616,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3616/","title":"Unit 7","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Unit 7","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Unit 7 of LL","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3617,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3617/","title":"Unit 9","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Unit 9","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Unit 9, LL","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":1,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1/","title":"EH Site | EH","control_properties":[{"property":"Season Number","value":"01: 1922-1923","inline":"","footnote":""}],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"EH Site | EH","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"E-Hur-Sag","inline_note":"","footnote":"named for the ehursag but does not contain that building itself"},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"EH Site","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Area EH is located within the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall south of the giparu. There are many other area designations given to parts of this space (such as DP and LR), but EH overall refers to the interior extent of the SW temenos wall from the south corner almost to the Nebuchadnezzar gate and extending east to the line of Pit F. Walls in the area were scattered and difficult to follow, so Woolley established a grid covering at least 55x100 meters in 5x5 squares. The grid is not well documented but publication shows that Woolley began numbers to the east, increasing to the west, and letters to the south, increasing to the north; square 1,A therefore sits in the SE corner -- 11,T in the NW.\r\n\r\nThe abbreviation EH stands for E-Hur-sag but the building of that name does not lie within this excavation zone. Woolley did not believe that the building to the east of this area (partially dug by H.R. Hall in 1919) was the e-hur-sag, the palace of Shulgi, despite bricks with the inscription of the building being found there. Instead he called that building Hall's Temple (HT) and sought the palace in many other places inside the temenos. He eventually conceded that HT was indeed the e-hur-sag and published EH without reference to the abbreviation's original meaning.\r\n\r\nThe area Woolley called EH was the area Hall called the 'tomb mound' because it was relatively high ground in which he found a number of graves. Woolley showed that these were the remains of graves beneath the floors of houses dating from the Isin-Larsa to Kassite periods. EH in this time was likely an extension of the domestic area EM. In the Ur III period there appear to have been larger public buildings here, but their remains were spotty at best. Tablets from this area and area EM show that the residents of the domestic quarter in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period were likely temple workers.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3442,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3442/","title":" C.21","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Woolley, in his first season, found inscribed bricks in the walls that mentioned Ur-Namma's temple of the moon god, and he concluded the building was actually a temple, dubbing the excavation area HT. He believed the actual ehursag palace to be located somewhere else within the temenos. Many of his subsequent excavation abbreviations attest to his search for the building, but he eventually agreed that HT was the ehursag itself.\r\n\r\nIn his fourth season, Woolley cleared the remaining extents of the building. He had already explored parts of the terrace wall on which it stood and came to find that it was part of the Ur III temenos wall.

H.R. Hall investigated a portion of the high ground at this site (his Area A) in 1919, finding the remains of domestic structures. Taylor had also cut a trench here in 1853. Woolley first tested the ground early in 1926 (season 4) and then dug more completely in season 5, concentrating on about 60x40 meters of space and excavating to a depth of approximately 5 meters from the surface. He dug through Kassite and other late remains that were particularly fragmentary. He reported two Kassite houses (which he dubbed High House and Hill House) that were complete enough to map, and eventually uncovered twelve houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. There were many graves beneath the floors and tablets were also relatively common. Most of the tablets have to do with the business of the temple, so the houses here probably belonged to temple workers.\r\n\r\nWoolley named the streets he found in areas EM and AH. He felt that by naming the streets he could more easily identify any particular house, giving them numbers along the street with odd numbers on one side and even on the other. Many of the street names recur in the English city of Bath, where Woolley owned a house.\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of area EM ('Quality Lane' on Woolley's map) was excavated as area DP in season 4. This was higher ground than much of the rest of EM and is mapped with only partial houses that are not published in any detail.

His building was repaired, without any\r\nnoticeable alterations, by Marduk-nadin-ahhe in the 11th century B.C.

To the NW of rooms 23 and 24 all traces of the building had disappeared and a shaft sunk between those rooms and the Nebuchadnezzar drain failed to find even the foundations of walls. Below the level of the drain came hard-packed brick earth, artificially rammed, in which (at depth 2.00 m.) was found a late carnelian cylinder seal (U. 775, UE X, 611), proving that the layer was relatively late.

Most striking were the changes in the Neo-Babylonian period when Woolley shows it combining with the dublalmah to the east. He believed that by this point the building was not sufficient to house the Ningal temple and the entu priestess together, and thus the so-called Palace of Belshaltinannar was constructed outside the temenos specifically to house the priestess herself.\r\n\r\nAt times Woolley refers to the giparu as the Great Ningal Temple, which can be confusing as the Kassite and Neo-Bablyonian Ningal temples had moved onto the ziggurat terrace to the north of the giparu (Area HD).

Woolley came to realize, however, that it was an enormous courtyard surrounded by rooms, and at times in the excavation it was simply referred to as the Ziggurat Courtyard. The path through the court led to the ziggurat terrace and eventually to the temple atop it. The court was likely a gathering place for special occasions of worship to the moon god (whose name Woolley read Nannar, but which we read today as Nanna). Therefore, Woolley eventually dubbed this space the Great Nannar Courtyard.\r\n\r\nArea PD is the large space to the east of the ziggurat terrace, substantially lower in elevation than the base of the ziggurat. It had many floors over many periods. It consisted of a large paved courtyard (some 50 x 75 meters) surrounded by rooms that may have been used for storage.

Despite being largely empty, this building was described by Woolley as one of the best preserved temples of the Neo-Babylonian period in Mesopotamia. \r\n\r\nThe temple covered 33x27 meters and some of the bricks in its walls bore the inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. Nonetheless, Woolley suggested Nabonidus as the more likely founder. The walls were of mud brick with baked brick facing up to a meter thick and they stood to a height of 6.5 meters. The entire building was filled with clean sand and Woolley proposed that it was, in fact, not the actual temple but a complete replica beneath the surface never intended for human use. The actual temple would have stood above and it had completely eroded away. Evidence for the upper temple was found in a few paving bricks of Nabonidus at a level equivalent to the floor of the nearby 'Palace of Belshaltinannar'. In fact, Woolley suggested that the Harbor Temple may have been a chapel specifically associated with this building.\r\n\r\nCreating such a substructure has apparent (much earlier) textual but not archaeological precedent. Woolley believed that after the sub-temple was complete, it was consecrated to the gods and then filled with sand, then an entire temple built again above it for human use.

The largest building was of the Ur III period, and it is this building to which the abbreviation BC typically refers in field notes. It sits at the northeastern edge of the Royal Cemetery. The main Ur III building was 35 x 27m and its southwest wall was preserved two meters in height, while its northeast wall was largely destroyed. Its walls were built with inscribed bricks of Shulgi. The overall layout of the building is much like a courtyard house but on a large scale and with more ritual furnishings. Attached to this building were two annexes, one northwest and the other southeast, built with bricks of Shulgi's son, Amar-Sin (see context AD). Beneath the entire building were three very large vaults. All of them had been plundered in antiquity and only scattered fragments of artifacts and bones were discovered inside. Nonetheless, Woolley believed that these vaults originally held the remains of the Ur III kings. For this reason, area BC is sometimes referred to as the Mausoleum Site.\r\n\r\nThe building was destroyed by Elamites, according to Woolley, and sometime thereafter houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period were constructed in the area (see House 30). Finally, the Neo-Babylonian Temenos wall was constructed over and through parts of the remains.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":56,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/56/","title":"House 30/A","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"House 30/A","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"House 30/A","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"House 30","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Five houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period infringed upon the ruins of the Shulgi Mausoleum and its Amar-Sin annexes.

Woolley felt that the Elamite destruction had been severe enough to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nThe southwest wall of the mausolea remained to a height of 2 meters while the northeast wall was substantially ruined and it is this northeastern side that is most heavily built over. Woolley excavated these houses quickly in his effort to uncover the larger Ur III structure and numbered them as one unit, House 30. Later he separated the plans into individual houses, labeled House 30 A-E. All were badly denuded and few finds came from them, though typically there were also graves beneath the floors that are better recorded.

Woolley excavated in area NH for a short time in season 9 and again for an even shorter time (\"a few days at the end of the season\" according to field reports) in season 12. He did not dig below the level of Neo-Babylonian housing as his goal was to expose the layout of a portion of the Neo-Babylonian town. Across much of the site, the Neo-Babylonian domestic remains were badly preserved and even here there were only the stubs of walls and some evidence of later, Persian, occupation. The houses used no baked brick and they were close to the surface, thus they had often disappeared almost completely. Nonetheless, Woolley recovered outlines of two streets and seven houses along with a number of late artifacts, including two pots filled with tablets dating from the reign of Nabopolassar up to that of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nNeo-Babylonian houses were much more spacious in ground plan than Old Babylonian and were typically built with a saw-toothed outer plan that Woolley had difficulty explaining. The streets were much more linear than earlier layouts and this implies developments in centralized town planning. Woolley attributed this entire domestic quarter, which he believed had been built on ground cleared of all other remains, to the time of Nebuchadnezzar.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that there were many artifacts recovered here and there were many graves excavated, there are only four field notecards extant and only cursory publication. When reporting graves, Woolley listed only house number, not room. Even the house numbers were assigned late, as evidenced by publication in UE9, which discusses House A and B while its map numbers 1-7. Houses 6 and 7 were certainly dug in 1931 when Woolley intended to extend area AH, but he changed his mind and only later went back to uncover the outlines of a few more houses south of these in the final season, including House 1, dug in 1934.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4390,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4390/","title":"Graves","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

At the excavation, the designation was used to refer to a large Neo-Babylonian structure in the northern portion of the site that was eventually dubbed the 'Palace of Bel-Shalti-Nannar.' The horizontal extent of this building is one of the largest at Ur and the layout resembles that of the 'Great House' in Merkes at Babylon. The building's foundations were preserved to a great depth (over 3 meters) and paved floors sat at the top of the intentional fill of these foundations. Walls did not extend much above this level and excavation consisted mostly of following the outlines in order to determine the ground plan. A few artifacts were recovered, primarily from intrusive graves and from foundation deposits.\r\n\r\nInscribed bricks in the preserved floor led Woolley to identify the building with the residence of the entu priestess in the Neo-Babylonian period. It was built for the daughter of Nabonidus, whose name we now read as Ennigaldi-Nanna but which in Woolley's day was read Bel-Shalti-Nannar. It may have had some administrative functions but it mainly appears to have been a large-scale residence.\r\n\r\nLegrain, in his museum work on inscribed materials, used the excavation area abbreviation AD to refer to a subsection of area BC (the mausoleum of the Ur III kings).

The sequence of pit letters was assigned after most had been dug, probably in season 8 as confusion arose over pits I and J. Pit F was originally called PFT to distinguish it from pits in the Royal Cemetery area. The suffix T probably stood for Temenos to show that Pit F was dug in the area inside the early temenos wall. The abbreviation became confusing and Legrain reports PF as 'Flood Pit' and PFT as 'Shaft in town area,' but the two designations are actually identical.\r\n\r\nThe term 'Flood Pit' was often used to refer to Pit F because of the deep layers of silt found near its deepest extent. As much as 3 meters thickness of fine water-lain soil was encountered here, evidence of a great flood. In his books and talks for the general public, Woolley often made the equation of this flood with the biblical flood, but in his academic discussions he never did. Instead, here he referred to the frequent flooding of the Euphrates and how this particular flood must have been large and may have spawned Sumerian legends.\r\n\r\nPit F was extremely large and extremely deep. Woolley's intent was to reach the earliest occupation of the site. He chose an already low-lying zone neighboring the excavation area EH and laid out a trench 15x25 meters, though in the southern half he only dug 10 meters width, making the final pit L shaped. He truncated the horizontal extent further as he dug down to avoid collapse and he eventually reached a depth of some 19 meters from the surface of the mound. The top of the pit had already been denuded to the Early Dynastic levels and thus late material was typically not found here. From the surface, Woolley found eight levels of early building remains going deeper and deeper. Beneath this he found pottery kilns and a deep layer of over-fired pottery fragments indicating manufacture. Near the bottom of this stratum he began finding Uruk period graves (that he called Jemdat Nasr period graves). He labeled these not with numbers, but with letters in the sequence PFG/A through PFG/XX. Below this he encountered the flood layer with Ubaid period graves cut into it. Beneath the flood layer he found evidence of Ubaid habitation near sea level and what he believed to be indications of the early marshlands in which Ur had originally been a very low mound.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4168,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4168/","title":"C.4","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Cemetery","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"PG; Private Graves","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"The excavation area abbreviation PG grew to refer to a large region, at least 60x80 meters, in the southeastern portion of the Neo-Babylonian temenos but below the level of that wall. The area is most often referred to as the Royal Cemetery. The abbreviation PG, however, was initially used to designate individual graves: PG1422, for example, refers to Private Grave number 1422. The first PG numbers were assigned in season 5 when a series of trial trenches (see TTD, TTE, TTF, and TTG) were excavated in the area. These trenches were expanded to uncover more and more graves over the next few seasons. The last number assigned in the PG sequence was around 1850 but numbers were often reassigned for publication and even in the field some numbers were combined as they were recognized to come from one large grave rather than two separate ones. Others were deemed to fragmentary to publish; furthermore, several hundred additional graves were found in Pit X, an expansion of the PG area dug in 1934. The total number of graves excavated in the Royal Cemetery is thus extremely difficult to determine. Woolley reports that there may once have been as many as three times the total number of graves he recorded, as he found many plundered and almost completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nDespite being called the Royal Cemetery, there were only 16 graves that Woolley actually dubbed 'royal.' He believed that these formed the core of the burial ground and that many other people wanted to be buried nearby. The cemetery lay outside of the original temenos, the core of the city, and was apparently a dumping ground through much of its history. Stratigraphic layers of sealings (see SIS) help to date the main period of the Royal Cemetery to the Early Dynastic III, though there are also graves of the Akkadian and perhaps some of the early Ur III period here. Well beneath the main PG area are also graves of the Uruk and Ubaid periods, but these were mainly uncovered in pits dug within or adjacent to area PG (see PJ, Pit W, Pit X, Pit Y and Pit Z).\r\n\r\nMost burials in area PG were simple inhumations with few artifacts, but the ones Woolley called royal were much more elaborate. Apart from having rich artifacts, they also showed evidence of human sacrifice -- many bodies were found in 'death pits' outside the main 'royal' burial. The people found in these death pits may have been attendants who went into the afterlife with their king or queen, yet no other indication of this practice is found elsewhere in Mesopotamia. Nor do we know who these 'kings and queens' were. The dating of the graves makes it difficult to associate them with a known dynasty at Ur and there were very few names found with any of the bodies. Only the burial of Puabi, the Queen, can be directly identified by her cylinder seal and she does not appear on any king list. References to Mesannepada and his wife Ninbanda, a king and queen of the first dynasty of Ur, were found but not in specific graves.

In fact, walls were not unusual in the Royal Cemetery as witnessed by this quote from UE4, p.70: \"Over a large part of the Cemetery area there extended walls of plano-convex mud bricks, at two distinct levels... All were thin and flimsy, all much destroyed by the diggers of the Cemetery graves.\" Woolley felt that these were just store rooms of a temporary nature.\r\n\r\nThe pits dug in the Royal Cemetery in season 7 were intended to test the lower levels and little if anything was collected from them. Pit G, however, appears to have been a prelude to Pit F and may have initially been conceived of as Pit F in the sequence. Pottery was collected from it and analyzed by Henri Frankfort in Antiquaries Journal volume 9. Initial mentions of the pit indicate it was to go to the lowest levels, but it only reached 7.5 meters above sea level. It also began at a much higher point than other trenches, at 14.5 above sea level. Woolley must have realized he needed a much larger pit to achieve his goals and began that as PFT in the next season. The shift from this pit to the much larger is likely the origin of Legrain's listing of separate PF and PFT contexts, and the beginning of Woolley's realization that he must rename the entire sequence of pits at Ur.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4605,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4605/","title":"Pit H","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Pit H","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Pit H","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Pit H","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Beginning in season 7, Woolley excavated a series of pits within the Royal Cemetery. He had already cut this area down about 10 meters from the surface, so it was an ideal location to go deeper to investigate the earliest occupation of the site. The only map of the location of these pits that Woolley published is found in Ur Excavations volume 4 in 1955, but it is demonstrably unreliable. Combining information from the field notes, the UE4 plan, and the UE4 stratigraphic profile helps to get closer to the actual sizes and locations, but most of these cannot be taken as exact.\r\n\r\nPit H is probably the smallest of the pits in the Royal Cemetery. It does not appear on the stratigraphic profile but is clearly stated to have been located in the middle of chamber B of PG/779. This is a small chamber measuring only 2x2 meters and the pit therefore must be this size or smaller. Woolley reports reaching 2.5 meters above sea level in the pit, beginning at the level of the chamber only 5.65 meters above sea level. Its relatively small horizontal and vertical extents are almost certainly why it does not appear on the profile drawing. It is also approximately in line with Pit A at the angle of the stratigraphic profile and would thus be difficult to include. Finally, it may actually be that the pit was dug in season 8, though there is no firm indication of this.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":1245,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1245/","title":"Pit W","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Pit W","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Pit W","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Pit W","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Pit W was excavated from the bottom of area PG near Pits Y and Z in order to more fully explore the Seal Impression Strata discovered running across the cemetery. Since these strata contained so many early seals and tablets it was clear that they were essential for dating the graves and for learning more about the administration of the city of Ur. In order to observe the strata more clearly, Pit W was much larger than most exploratory pits in the cemetery region, laid out to be 15x7 meters. It was dug from the northeast side of PG/1631 but its horizontal extents were not mapped. Its published stratigraphic profile shows that PG/1631 was actually somewhere near the middle of the long side of the trench and Woolley states that Pit W was placed so as to virtually fill the gap between Pits Y and Z, but was set a few meters northeast of them. This allows for a relatively accurate placement of the pit. \r\n\r\nPit W quickly ran through the seal impression strata but Woolley continued it down much farther, as he had with Pits Y and Z, to reach about a meter below sea level. He thus uncovered many graves earlier than the main Royal Cemetery, and because he believed them to be from the Jemdet Nasr period, he began JNG numbers for them. This discovery, combined with early graves in Pit Y, spawned the conception of a Jemdet Nasr cemetery running beneath and south of the Royal Cemetery, and in season 12 Woolley would seek to expose it in Pit X.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4243,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4243/","title":"JNG/1","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

expanded the Royal Cemetery (area PG) to the southwest and northeast. After digging more of the southwestern extent, he decided to investigate deeper still in two pits larger than those he dug in season 7 but not as large as Pit F in the Temenos area. These two pits were initially Pits I and J in the sequence but confusion with lettering caused Woolley to begin at the end of the alphabet and rename these pits Y and Z.\r\n\r\nPit I was located northwest of Pit J along the southwestern line of the Royal Cemetery excavation and was quickly renamed Pit Z. There are very few references to Pit I in the field records. Legrain lists PIG as a pit near PFT and the final letter G shows that it was within the Royal Cemetery area rather than the Temenos area. Pit Z is about 50 meters southeast of Pit F. The published stratigraphic profile shows it to be 6 meters wide at the top and 4 meters wide at the bottom. Its sides sloped in order to prevent collapse. It reached just below sea level and it revealed more of the seal impression strata that ran through the cemetery. This pit and Pit Y both uncovered graves earlier than the Royal Cemetery main burials. These graves were eventually given JNG numbers, a continuous sequence across Pits W, X, Y, and Z that collectively came to be considered area PJ. Several, however, were initially given PG numbers and later renumbered in the JNG sequence.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3725,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3725/","title":"JNG/368","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Description","property_value":"Ur Excavations vol. 2: \"This grave illustrated more fully than any other the ritual of a royal burial; the soil above it was full of later graves the digging of which had destroyed any superstructure that there might have been and the upper part of the tomb-shaft; the tops of the original walls were only encountered at a depth of 4-00 m. below the modern surface. But below this there had been no disturbance and the tomb and its accessories were intact. The excavation was not easy, partly because the virtual disappearance of the south-east wall and the fact that the north-east wall was for a long while not discovered, being hidden under the earth ramp made for our basket-men, prevented us at first from seeing that we were dealing with one definite shaft, and the different stratification on the two sides of the cross-wall, at least in the upper levels, further concealed the truth. The higher part of the shaft sides were never found and are therefore only dotted in on the section. The correlation of field notes written quite independently was not simple, but fortunately there were enough points of contact, and the section, though slightly schematic, does give the facts fairly accurately.\"\r\n","inline_note":"","footnote":"UE 2 p. 97"},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"Woolley believed this royal tomb to show the process of ritual surrounding the burial and building of the grave shaft. The tomb is a complex one, consisting of a deep, walled shaft above a rubble and earth domed tomb. Woolley believed that the burials in the shaft acted as a kind of death pit, thus he believed the bodies in the shaft to be attendants to the primary burial in the domed chamber below.\r\n\r\nIn the main chamber were the bodies of five people, four men and one woman. The woman was clearly an important person, lying in the center of the tomb and having a gold cylinder seal as well as other high value objects, including much carnelian. The walls of the shaft above began from a layer packed over the domed chamber and in theory could be a different grave entirely. However, Woolley believed he had evidence of a continuous process that included the packing and smoothing of layers above the dome and then the construction of the shaft. In the shaft, at differing levels, were four more burials. Some of these also possessed rather high-end objects and one had nearby a cylinder seal with the name of Meskalamdug, the King. In his section of PG1054, Woolley reconstructed a dome over this grave, but later intrusive burials had destroyed the upper walls and, if it had been there, the upper, smaller dome.","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Nissen

Description","property_value":"The positive depth of this grave, 9.50 m. below the present surface, is deceptive in that rubbish containing light-coloured bricks apparently of Third Dynasty type were here found at a depth of six metres, and the bottom of the shaft (which could be traced only below this level) was probably only about 3.50 m. below the contemporary ground-surface. \r\n\r\nThe bottom of the pit was lined with plano-convex mud bricks which had been concealed by a further lining of mats; so far as could be made out, the weave of the matting was unusual and produced a rectangular panel pattern. At the bottom of the pit, but not quite filling it, was a wooden coffin measuring I.90 m. by 0.80 m. and 0.65 m. deep. The coffin lid was gabled, made of two planks of which one, 0.28 m. wide, was remarkably well preserved-that is, the impression and colour of it left in the soil was remarkably clear, v. PI. 78a; the sides were strengthened with five external stays, 0.06 m. by 0.03 m. thick, one at each corner and the others at intervals of 0.40 m. In\r\nthe coffin the body lay with its head to the north-west on its right side in the usual slightly flexed attitude; the skull was completely crushed by fallen earth; the body was that of a man.","inline_note":"","footnote":"UE 2 p.185"},{"prop":"Nissen

He also began mapping individual graves, establishing at least 4 mapping points from which he took angular measures to pinpoint locations. Unfortunately he never showed where these stakes were placed on any map so we can no longer utilize the recorded angles. \r\n\r\nCards from this season that bear the abbreviation PGA all concern textual material.

He had to leave this particular grave at the end of the season and return to it in season 6. TTE also hit the stone roofing of PG777 but left it intact. PG580 and PG777 were mapped and show the direction and general placement of TTE.\r\n\r\nTTE almost immediately began revealing graves, some of them relatively rich in gold jewelry. It is probably for this reason that Woolley did not continue TTD to any great depth but chose instead to focus on TTE. In fact, he later began extending TTE into new trenches along the same line (TTF and TTG). He assigned numbers to each grave as it was uncovered, preceded by the abbreviation PG (Private Grave). The initial sequence, PG1-PG226 were all located within TTE. The sequence then began to share with TTF and eventually with TTG. Unfortunately, none of the first 579 graves were ever mapped within the length of their trial trenches.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4366,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4366/","title":"PG/261","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Like the other trenches in the royal cemetery it was never mapped and does not appear on an aerial photograph. The trench was dug on the same lines as TTE, essentially extending its width, and the only report that shows its southern line is a mention of the location of PG513 within it. This grave rested upon the ruined northwest wall of PG777, which means that TTF must have met TTE at PG777, since the roof of that grave was revealed in TTE. TTF therefore extended the width of TTE to the northwest.\r\n\r\nThe calculated location of TTF crosses over at least the southern end of TTA. This trench had been dug four years prior and had not been overly deep. It would likely have been mostly collapsed by this point, accounting for the somewhat different line of it and the season 5 trenches TTE, TTF, and TTG. While TTE was almost certainly around 3.5 meters in width as had been previous trial trenches, TTF and TTG may have been wider in order to find more graves. The only indication is the 1930 aerial photograph that shows an extent in the northwest portion of the cemetery that may go as far as 17 meters from the northwest edge of TTE. It is by no means certain, but a trench width of 6-7 meters (twice that of TTE) is suggested for each of TTF and TTG.\r\n\r\nThe first grave to be given a PG number in TTF was PG227. From this point, the sequence of grave numbers is shared between the two trenches, eventually to be supplemented with TTG.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4463,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4463/","title":"PG/227","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

actually extending TTF and obliterating TTA. Like the other trenches in the Royal Cemetery it was never mapped and does not appear on an aerial photograph. The trench was dug on the same lines as TTF, essentially extending its width to the northwest. The first grave to be numbered in this trench was PG355, but the sequence from this point up to PG580 is shared among the three trenches. Like TTF, this trench was probably wider than standard trial trenches, though there is no proof of that other than a slight indication on the 1930 aerial photograph. Excavation while the three trenches were open would have resembled a wide stair case, with TTE being the lowest in the southeast, TTF somewhat higher to the northwest, and TTG higher still. By the end of the season, all three trenches had reached at least 5 meters depth, though TTE had reached 9 meters.\r\n\r\nThe northwest portion of the cemetery did not produce as many graves as the southeast and Woolley extended excavations in the following season over a large area southeast of TTE, beginning with PG580. He also began to map individual graves in the overall area at this point.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":2098,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/2098/","title":"PG/355","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Description","property_value":"Pit X was excavated as a large southern extension of the Royal Cemetery area, likely originally conceived as an extension of Pit Y (Pit J) at the southwest corner. Its main purpose was to uncover the earliest burials in the area, the so-called Jemdat Nasr cemetery first encountered in pits Y and Z. Pit X measured approximately 30x15 meters, though it may originally have been laid out to be 35x20. Woolley reports it as a rectangle covering 1000 square meters, but even the largest indication on the plan map and satellite images is at most 700 square meters and not truly rectangular. Nevertheless, it is a very large space that reached sea level some 20 meters below the surface of the mound. In the Antiquaries Journal for 1934 Woolley reports a total of 13,160 cubic meters of dirt having been removed from this pit.\r\n\r\nSome minor building remains of the Neo-Babylonian and Kassite periods were found near the surface but most of the area was apparently used as a dumping ground in the Late Bronze Age and later. Woolley knew that the Royal Cemetery area extended to the south of his main area PG but believed he would find few graves of the Akkadian and EDIII period. He discovered more than he expected, but none were overly rich in finds. These graves did not receive PG numbers since the UE2 Royal Cemetery volume had already been published. Instead, they received PJ numbers. The series PJG applied to graves in Pit X Woolley felt to be Akkadian or later and PJB applied to those of the EDIII period. The break between these two sequences came at around 10 meters above sea level. In all, Pit X added some 250 to the more than 1000 burials of these periods that Woolley had already uncovered in area PG.\r\n\r\nBeneath the graves of the Royal Cemetery (starting at around 6 meters above sea level) Woolley reached the earlier graves of what he called the Jemdat Nasr cemetery. Graves at this depth were given JNG numbers. In fact, JNG eventually applied to all of the early graves discovered in pits W, X, Y, and Z. Some of those excavated in Y and Z had received PG numbers but they were renumbered for publication in the JNG sequence. Most of these graves actually date to the Early Dynastic I period.\r\n\r\nThe area near the base of the pit was smaller than that at the top. Only around 400 square meters was exposed near sea level, yet more than 200 early graves were discovered. Although Ubaid period pottery fragments were found, only two Ubaid burials were discovered here. The large area excavation stopped at 2 meters above sea level, but a test pit at the bottom reached down to sea level itself.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":3865,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3865/","title":"Jemdat Nasr Graves ","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

southwest and northeast. After digging more of the southwestern extent, he decided to investigate deeper still in two pits larger than those he dug in season 7 but not as large as Pit F in the Temenos area. These two pits were initially Pits I and J in the sequence but confusion with lettering caused Woolley to begin at the end of the alphabet and rename these pits Y and Z.\r\n\r\nPit J was located in the far southwestern corner of the expanded Royal Cemetery of season 8 and was quickly renamed Pit Y. The published stratigraphic profile shows it to be 12 meters wide at the top but within 1 meter of depth it shifted to only 6.5 meters width. At the bottom, where it reached sea level, the pit had been further reduced to 5 meters width, and a smaller segment of 3 meters size was taken another meter down below sea level. This pit and Pit Z both uncovered graves earlier than the Royal Cemetery main burials. These graves were eventually given JNG numbers, a continuous sequence across Pits W, X, Y, and Z that collectively came to be considered area PJ. PJ initially stood for Pit J but the concentration of burials found in this pit (renamed Pit Y) gave rise to the use of the abbreviation PJ for graves in the southern extension of area PG in Pit X. Woolley believed the early graves to come from the Jemdat Nasr period (thus JNG). Note also that some JNG graves initially held PG numbers, especially in the PG/1800 sequence, and were later renumbered.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4710,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4710/","title":"JNG/348","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Badly preserved remains of a building were found here, distinct from the giparu. On a tentative reconstruction of the ground plan, Woolley suggests the original structure measured some 35x40 meters. The building remains date to the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period and many small tablets recording business transactions were found within. T.C. Mitchell, editing the UE 7 volume published after Woolley's death, notes that many of these tablets actually date to the reigns of Shulgi and Amar-Sin. According to Woolley, some of the tablets were twisted together as if in the process of being recycled to reuse their clay for new tablets. He also suggests, very tentatively and based only on a few minor and out-of-place bricks, that this building was originally a temple to Nin-Ezen.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":7,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/7/","title":"Temenos Wall | TW","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Temenos Wall | TW","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"TW","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Temenos Wall","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"The excavation area abbreviation TW stands for Temenos Wall, a wall that surrounded the ziggurat terrace and its extended sacred space in the northern central portion of the city of Ur through much of its history. The wall may have begun in the Early Dynastic period, as Woolley found some indication of what he believed to be its earliest foundation. There was clearly an Ur III period version that ran south of the giparu and then further southeast to encompass the ehursag. This was the general line of the wall through the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian and into the Kassite period, though the Kassites made some changes in the northern portion. Finally, the Neo-Babylonians changed the wall greatly, expanding the area encompassed to the north and south and adding several gateways. The foundations of this later, quite massive, wall often destroyed earlier remains.\r\n\r\nWoolley explored parts of the temenos wall in many seasons and frequently used the TW abbreviation for the wall in any of its building periods. Other excavation area abbreviations include parts of the temenos, particularly NCF, PDW and BC. The temenos wall built by Urnamma was 6 meters thick and built of mud brick with a baked brick facing. Most of the baked brick had been removed, probably for later building. The Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus temenos wall had chambers within it and sported six gates into the temenos area. This area was known as e-gish-nu-gal (Woolley read this e-gish-shir-gal). At least one later interpretation  conflates TW with the phrase Town Wall, but the wall surrounding Ur was always referred to as the city wall, (CLW).","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4598,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4598/","title":"Graves","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Graves","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4596,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4596/","title":"Larsa Grave","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Larsa Grave","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":845,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/845/","title":"LG/175 | TWG/1.1929","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"LG/175 | TWG/1.1929","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"TW Grave/L, 1929","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Larsa Grave 175","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"On city wall, NE side below Larsa house ruins.\r\n","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Burial Type","property_value":"Larnax B.\r\n","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Pottery Types","property_value":"49, 83.","inline_note":"","footnote":"Imported from BM list of contexts."},{"prop":"Skeletal Remains","property_value":"Two bodies, one con-tracted, head NE, the later in confusion.

This building was located at the west corner of the temenos where it meets the ziggurat terrace and turns to the south. Publication UE9 refers to this specific structure as the West Corner Fort, built by Nebuchadnezzar at the corner of his temenos wall. An earlier fortification had been uncovered in season 3, which Woolley called the Bastion of Warad Sin. This structure sits at the north corner of the ziggurat terrace, approximately mid-way along the northwest temenos wall and may have functioned as a kind of sally port gate. It was sometimes called the north corner fort in early seasons but artifacts were not catalogued with this abbreviation in those seasons. Any artifacts from the Warad Sin building were likely catalogued instead with the abbreviation PDW. Nebuchadnezzar's Corner Fort may also have been defensive, but it contained in its later phase a large mixing basin filled with bitumen. In the time of Nabonidus it may well have been in use in repairing the ziggurat.\r\n\r\nWoolley dug beneath the Nebuchadnezzar Corner Fort, still using the abbreviation NCF, and uncovered what he believed was a temple or shrine.","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":48,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/48/","title":"YNNCF","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context

Catalog card references mention the \"back of Hall's excavation\" and \"alongside mud brick wall running NE by SW, S of EgigPar and parallel with Temenos wall.\" South of the giparu there is no good candidate for the wall mentioned, but south of the ehursag there is and it is likely that egigpar was written when ehursag was intended. Furthermore, the area known as FH shows that the 'Front of Hall's excavation' was north-northwest of this building. Therefore, TTC at the 'back of Hall's excavation' should be south-southeast. The aerial photo shows a trench about 3.5 meters wide and 30 meters long that sits east-southeast of the ehursag and is very likely to be TTC. The only other possible candidate is a trench almost exactly the same size located southwest of the giparu, north of area EM. This trench, however, is mentioned in a season three field report (not given any abbreviation) as an exploration of an area to be dug the following season (area EM). Since that trench was dug in the season before artifacts are recorded as coming from TTC, the only trench that could be TTC is the one near area HT (ehursag).","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":29,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/29/","title":"XNCF","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"XNCF","inline_note":"","footnote":"Outside Nebuchadnezzar's Corner Fort"},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"XNCF Site","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"XNCF","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"This area lies along the edge of northwest temenos wall east of the Nebuchadnezzar Corner Fort (NCF).

Early references using the abbreviation ZT refer specifically to excavations along the terrace retaining wall itself. Later references, however, mention specific areas on top the terrace such as the so-called 'boat shrine.' The abbreviation also refers to deep clearing of the terrace fill, particularly on the north side in later excavation seasons, though the abbreviation Zig.31 was most often used for this.\r\n\r\nWoolley uncovered large areas of the retaining wall that supported the platform known as the ziggurat terrace. He found that it was decorated with large wall cones. These cones bore an inscription of Urnamma but there is evidence that the terrace in some form existed in the Early Dynastic period as well. The Urnamma retaining wall was slanted to support the terrace, was 1.7 meters high, 34 meters wide, and was decorated with 5-meter-wide buttresses about 4 meters apart. The inscribed cones dedicate the terrace to the moon god, Nanna, and show that it was called e-temen-ni-gur, which translates as, \"house, foundation platform clad in terror.\" (Woolley read this e-temen-ni-il).","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":4109,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4109/","title":"Courtyard BB","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Courtyard BB","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Courtyard BB","inline_note":"","footnote":""}]},{"id":13,"url":"http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/13/","title":"Ningal Temple | HD","control_properties":[],"free_form_properties":[{"prop":"Context Title","property_value":"Ningal Temple | HD","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Excavation)","property_value":"Hall's Dump","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Name (Publication)","property_value":"Ningal Temple; Southern Ziggurat Terrace","inline_note":"","footnote":""},{"prop":"Context Description","property_value":"The excavation area abbreviation HD stands for Hall's Dump.

It was expanded and renamed Pit K in season 9. The pit was located within the area of PDW, on top of the northwest portion of the ziggurat terrace and cut down into its filling. Woolley had hoped to find early buildings beneath the terrace but only uncovered fill of broken bricks and Ubaid period pottery. He dug a second pit to the west on the line of the terrace wall (see Pit L). Woolley is unclear on the exact placement of either pit and the only plan published does not correspond well with his notes. In a field report dated Feb. 1, 1931,  he speaks of removing the Neo-Babylonian sanctuary of Nannar and making this the site of his deep pit. This building sat on the northeastern side of the terrace, just north of the ziggurat's central staircase. In publication UE4, however, Woolley states that the pit was located in the center of the northwest portion of the terrace (the plan shows it falling in the UrIII shrine of Nannar). At this point Woolley also states the pit was dug in 1932, but all field records indicate it was dug in January, 1931 (and begun as PAT in 1925).\r\n\r\nIn the season 9 excavation it is clear that Woolley intended to excavate a deep trench on the terrace that included both PAT and PBT.  He laid out an area measuring some 20x40 meters that included the smaller pits. This excavation uncovered the early and quite dense terrace wall, so Woolley continued as two pits, Pit K and Pit L, falling essentially on either side of it. Pit K was farther southeast and measured 11x20 meters, stepping in to become 9.5 meters at a depth of 7 meters from the surface. It continued down to sea level, about 14 meters below the surface. These measurements are obtained from the stratigraphic profile published in UE4, but it is admittedly difficult to interpret. The only scale on the image is the vertical and this scale appears to have been exaggerated to show the strata while including the entire horizontal extent on the page. When the portion of the ziggurat included on the drawing is scaled to meet its appropriate horizontal, the Pit K profile is shown to be approximately 11 meters NW-SE at the top.\r\n\r\nTwo season 8 artifacts have the context Ziggurat Pit A (with a note that this was renamed Pit K).

When Woolley listed Ziggurat or Zig as the context for an artifact, he usually included that it was at the foot, along the south wall, or some other region of the ziggurat itself. In 1931, however, he began using the code Zig.31 to indicate the deep cuts across and in front of the northern terrace that were essentially under the excavation area PDW. Many of the artifacts with the excavation area abbreviation Zig.31 come from the Ubaid period.

This makes the general boundaries west, south, and east somewhat known but how far it stretched north is not completely clear.\r\n\r\nFrom the first season workers walking across this area picked up surface finds and brought them to Woolley. At that time the location did not have a fixed name in Woolley's mind and thus first season references sometimes say 'near the railway' or 'near Munshid's water engine.' In the second season Woolley decided to investigate more systematically, but after two days of excavation he decided there was not enough remaining architecture to reward further work. Instead, he continued to allow the workers to gather finds over the next ten seasons, and many later catalog cards state \"brought in: Diqdiqqeh\"\r\n\r\nThe finds from Diqdiqqeh indicate that the ancient suburb played a role in manufacturing and perhaps in commerce.
