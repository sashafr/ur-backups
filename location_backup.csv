Ur,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/2/,Ur,Ur; Tell el-Muqayyar,When Woolley lists context only as 'Ur' on his object catalog cards he tends to mean that it was found somewhere within the confines of the city wall but no more specific than that. These are often surface finds that Woolley felt did not require more specific find spot information. Those found outside the city walls were typically recorded as 'brought in' followed by the name of the broad region from which they were brought in by the workers.
AH Site | AH,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/5/,AH Site | AH,AH Site,"In the southeast portion of the mound of Ur, Woolley excavated a large horizontal extent of domestic space roughly 115 x 85m. near the surface he found scattered Neo-Babylonian and Kassite remains and intrusive graves of the late periods but he did not publish these in detail nor are there any extant notes covering them. Instead, Woolley's main goal was to uncover the best preserved floorplans of houses. These he found several meters down, houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. Because the Old Babylonian period was typically that associated with the potential time of Abraham, Woolley used the abbreviation AH (Abraham's Housing) to refer to this excavation area.

In the course of excavation of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian levels Woolley numbered 27 'houses,' or excavation units. He renumbered the houses for publication based on the overall plan, preserved walls, and doors onto streets. In this way he showed there were 52 individual houses within his 27 excavation areas. However, houses were frequently altered throughout period, as families would knock out walls or block up doors, and thus true house numbers are difficult to establish. Woolley mentions phases of rebuilding, but states that he sought the best preserved floor plan and published the excavation of a particular house based on that plan alone. In some cases he noted deeper remains that may have gone back to the Ur III period. These levels he partially uncovered as he excavated graves beneath the Larsa period floors.

A great deal of baked brick was in use for walls of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. Some houses used it in the lowest portion of a wall, but others used it for entire walls up to 3 meters in height. Town planning was not evident, as streets tended to wander in narrow and winding paths. Corners where streets met were often rounded, leading Woolley to surmise that this was to prevent problems with laden donkeys catching their wares on corners.

Many houses had a domestic chapel within, often with family burials beneath the floor. Communal chapels were also noted, at least four being identified in the area. Finally, Woolley believed that some buildings were specifically used for commercial activities (shops), though this is difficult to prove.",AH; Abraham's Housing

Here there were on the right hand side two buildings closely resembling No. 12 Paternoster Row, with narrow frontages and deep rooms behind, each divided by cross-walls into three compartments (allowing for the destruction of one wall in No. 1), probably shops with magazines behind. A doorway across the alley was followed by another turn to the NE; in the angle was the entrance to a third long narrow building which may have been of a similar nature to the other two but looked more like a converted chapel. Another door closed the alley which beyond it emerged into a square room part of which may well have been occupied by a coster's stall, for along the NE wall, clear of the thoroughfare, there lay on the ground two large clay pots, Type IL. 61, a number of rough pounders and rubbing-stones and a limestone palette c. 0.25 m. sq.

Everything that had been in the building at the moment of its destruction had been preserved in situ. The NE wall stood from ten to seventeen courses high - where it was most ruined the water-laid strata ran over the top of it, showing that there was no rebuilding; the SW wall stood to seven courses, the NW also to seven; the floor was brick-paved, but in the west corner the pavement stopped short at 0.54 m. from the NW wall, and at 1.00 m. from the SW wall, and from the face of that wall three or four bricks projected by as much as 0.15 m., showing that there had been here some kind of pedestal whose front was presumably flush with that of the bases flanking the doorway, though the latter were not bonded into the wall, as whatever stood here in the corner must have been. In the NW wall were two doors, one leading to the passage, Room 5, the other, distinguished by reveals to its jambs, opening on the sanctuary.

Against the NE wall, at 1.20 m. from the east corner of the court, there was a gap in the pavement 1.40 m. long and 0.65 m. wide; this may have been due simply to the disappearance of some of the paving-bricks, but was possibly the site of some construction in mud or mud brick, possibly a base.",,,,,

The wall along Church Lane was somewhat pretentious, for twenty-five courses of burnt brick still survived; round the main court (Room 1) there were sixteen courses, but behind this the building utilised older walls of which the burnt-brick foundations were buried deep underground and only the mud brick showed above ground level. There were therefore two periods represented, of which the front of the house belonged to the later. It is peculiar that there were two front doors, one leading straight into the central court and one into the small passage-room (2) which is more like the normal lobby. At a later time, when the court level had risen by 0.60 m. or more, the door into it was walled up and only that into the passage used. It is further peculiar that access to the two rooms (3) and (4) was through the passage only and that they had no doors onto the central court - it is a most rare exception to the rule of the omen-texts.",,Isin-Larsa,,,,

In the NW wall there seems to have been a door opening on Old Street which was afterwards blocked and a mud-brick wall built in front of it; but the state of the wall was so ruinous that no certain conclusions can be derived from it, and it is possible that there was a shop (?) window with a mud-brick counter inside it.",,,,,,

The threshold lay flush with the eighth course of burnt brick, implying a certain rise in the ground level. Later the ground rose more and a new burnt-brick NW jamb was built for the front door, not quite on the lines of the old, while the mud brickwork of the upper part of the wall continued to serve as the SE jamb, and the floor and threshold were raised by 0.50 m.; Later there was another rise of about 0.30 m., and later again the door was definitely blocked up as we found it.",,,,,,

To make accommodation for it the south corner of No. 14 had to be sacrificed, but instead of following Bazaar Alley to what was presumably the original street angle the builders had thrown forward the facade so as to secure additional space. Even so the building was very small. The chapel faced on a small open space and commanded a view down Paternoster Row (P1. 19b); it lay high and a flight of brick steps led up to a threshold 0.65 m. above street level, and this was shown to be its original height by the fact that the jambs of the door-opening did not go down below the threshold whereas in most of the neighbouring houses the door openings went down well below street level although added thresholds may have raised that opening by 0.50 m. or even by 1.00 m.; alongside the chapel a similar flight of steps led from Paternoster Row to Bazaar Alley, the level of which was the same as that of the chapel pavement. The chapel then was built at a time when the street level was that shown in our photograph, a level acquired only after most of the houses bordering the street had been standing for some while; it stood so high above the street that no reconstruction to meet a rise in level was necessary during the lifetime of the quarter; this height was obtained by the demolition of the south part of No. 14, and the chapel walls were newly built ad hoc, the burnt brick in them rising nine and on the SE side twelve courses above that in the older house walls.",,,,,,

The building had been twice rebuilt after its original foundation and had undergone minor alterations as well.
The original building had a rounded corner made with specially moulded bricks; on Paternoster Row there was an offset of 0.08 m., on Store Street the foundations and the face of the wall proper were flush; of it only three courses of burnt brick remained. On these, as a foundation, was built the second version of the chapel; on Paternoster Row it started flush with the old wall, but ran crooked and soon fell back from its line, on Store Street it had a set-back of 0.10 m. throughout its length. Its corner instead of being rounded was taken off by a hollow reveal. On Paternoster Row there was a doorway 0.90 m. wide at 3.25 m. from the comer with its threshold three courses above the offset of the old wall; on Store Street there was another at the same level also 0.90 m. wide at 3.80 m. from the corner.  In its latest form the chapel was divided into three parts by a cross-wall running NW X SE which cut off the base of the triangle and by a wall at right angles to this which divided the base or SW end into two. The triangular entrance-court was paved with bricks 0.23 m.

It was not all of one date, as regards its foundation, and it included a virtually independent house of small size (Rooms 16-19) which had once had its own door opening on the street, but as found by us it was undoubtedly a single unit. Owing to its size and complication we gave it the name ""The Khan"", being unprepared to find a private house with nineteen or more ground-floor rooms; but it must be admitted that the presence at the back of the building of a large domestic chapel with many burials is against such an identification and this may have been merely the home of a wealthier citizen than the others living in the quarter and may be not less typical of its class than are the more modest houses of theirs.

In connection with the later floor there were (1) against the SW wall a narrow trough or bench with burnt brick top and a raised edge of bricks set on end and (2) in the middle of the floor, almost between the two SE doors, a shallow rectangular box-like arrangement, of bricks set on edge with plain earth in the centre, measuring 1.05 m.

The walls stood to a maximum height of 2.45 m., showing seven courses of burnt brick; in the NE wall, at 1.55 m. east of the doorway to Room 7, there was at 1.95 m. above the pavement a circular beam-hole running right through the mud brickwork of the wall; this was probably a rafter supporting the outer end of a pent-house roof which sheltered the NW end of the chapel. In the SW wall there had been a door to No. 1 Bazaar Alley which had been blocked by a thin screen with seven courses of burnt brick and mud brick above (matching the wall) so as to leave a shallow niche. At the NW end was a brick altar, the front of it plastered with bitumen, and in the wall behind it was an incense-hearth 0.26 m. deep which started on the level of the altar top, 0.45 m. above the pavement. Next to it in the west corner, on a brick base 0.80 m. sq., was a ""table"" 0.62 m. sq.

The foundations of the latter were not so deeply laid as those of No. 4 Paternoster Row and here actually overlapped the projecting footings of its burnt brickwork; the Paternoster Row house must therefore have been the earlier of the two, but there were rights of ownership which prevented the builders of the Straight Street house from utilising the existing wall in their own construction.",,,,,,

No. 4 A was at an early period connected with No. 4, forming virtually an annexe to it, its entrance being through the lobby of No. 4, and also a communicating door in Room 2. Later both of these were walled up and there was a door opening directly on Paternoster Row. Later again this was walled up, largely with burnt brick, to the full height of the standing wall, and the door to the lobby of No. 4 seems to have been re-opened. Judging by the depth of foundations, the oldest parts of No. 4 A were older than anything in No. 4; its central period was about contemporary with the first occupation of No. 4 and there were later phases also.",,Isin-Larsa,,,,

Whereas the original floor of No. 1 Broad Street (The School House) next door was flush with the offset of its outer wall, the original threshold of No. 1 Store Street was fifteen courses of burnt brick (1.35 m.) above that offset and was raised first 0.30 m. and later 1.10 m., so that the street level rose nearly a metre and a half during the interval between the building of the School House and of this, and rose another metre during the lifetime of No. 1 Store Street. On the inside of the street wall there was an offset corresponding to the early threshold and in Room 8 there were remains of brick pavement at this level; in the same room, and in Room 1 and elsewhere, the existing pavement was 0.40 m. above the offset and so corresponded with the first raising of the front-door threshold. The internal walls had their foundations on the offset level, but some of them were re-built over older mud-brick walls following the same lines; the east (outer) wall had burnt brick foundations going down 0.80 m. lower and resting on mud brick and the west wall went down for 0.90 m. with mud brick below, while the street wall went down in burnt brick 1.20 m. below the door threshold. That the mud brick below the walls was not contemporary foundation is shown by the fact that its top was not flat and regular, but broken, so that the burnt brick above had had to be stepped down at intervals to secure a proper footing in the gaps. It follows therefore that the house as it has survived was a reconstruction of an older building of a more or less similar design, but that older building was of definitely earlier date than the quarter in general (i.e., of the Third Dynasty rather than of the Larsa period) and the lack of any front door in its wall on Store Street implies a different orientation if not an altered street line.

Of the stairs only the bottom tread was preserved; at a time when the level of the courtyard had been raised and a clay floor laid down c. 1.00 m. above the original pavement a hole was dug into the filling of the lower part of the stairs and a terracotta bread-oven, diam. 0.65 m., was let into it, destroying all the treads; the earth round it was burnt to a deep red.",,,,,,

The room had undergone several changes. The SW wall, which went up in burnt brick to 1.80 m., was originally the outside wall of the house; at a later time a door was cut through it to Room 12, but then the door was blocked by a rough screen wall and finally, when the kitchen floor had risen 0.90 m. above its old level, the door was again opened.

No. 4 Straight Street,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/106/,No. 4 Straight Street,No. 4 Straight Street,"A solidly built and compact house with rooms symmetrically arranged about a central court: the exceptionally heavy walls suggest that this house may have stood to a considerable height, and that there may have been a heavy roof to support. The site was nearly rectangular but the SE wall ran askew, following the angle of Paternoster Row. The burnt-brick superstructure of the house stood in places as much as twenty-two courses high, and the high level of the top pavement suggests that most of this superstructure belonged to the end of the Larsa period, shortly before the destruction by Samsu-iluna. On the tops of some of the Larsa walls there were flimsy remains of burnt-brick walls of the Kassite period, and much of the Larsa brick-work had been torn down and levelled to make an even foundation for the walls of the Kassite house. On the other hand much of the evidence suggests that this house dated back to an ancient foundation in Third Dynasty times. The burnt-brick walls of the Larsa period followed along the lines of an older mud-brick structure, and between the pavement associated with this older building and that of the end of the Larsa period, there was an accumulation of more than 1.6 metres of debris. The rubbish in the courtyard underneath the late Larsa pavement consisted of decayed mud brick and contained carinated saucers of Third Dynasty type. In the SW wall there was an inscribed brick of Amar-Suena, but the fact that this wall did not go as deep as the boundary wall of No. 4 Paternoster Row and that the foundations of No. 4 Straight Street appeared to overlap the burnt-brick work of No. 4 Paternoster Row indicates that the latter was an earlier foundation still.; The brickwork and pavements in this room give a convenient summary of the history of this house which divides itself into four main periods: 1. The earliest foundation, mud brick walls and burnt brick pavements, probably going back to Third Dynasty; 2. Burnt brick superstructure erected over the mud brick foundations in the Larsa period, good burnt brick pavements associated, access given to No. 2 Straight Street by doorways in the SE wall; 3.

In the Larsa period there had been a door in the NE wall which was blocked in the Kassite period. The earliest burnt-brick pavement, contemporary with the mud brick walls of the early foundation had bricks measuring 0.275 X 0.18 X 0.07 m. The Kassite SE wall was only 0.75 m. thick and contained burnt-bricks measuring 0.24-0.25 X 0.16 X 0.065 m. and there were other bricks 0.185 and 0.15 m. wide.",,,,,,

In the SE corner of the court there was a heavy rectangular blocking of mud bricks, 0.26 X 0.165 X 0.075 m. very roughly laid. This blocking had obviously never had an exposed face, and was probably intended to serve as a kisui or support for the later party walls at this corner of the court where the foundations were of poor quality. The remains of two pavements were still preserved. The uppermost was built two courses above the footings of the burnt brick walls and consisted of mixed burnt-bricks, 0.30 sq. X 0.05 m. and 0.31 m. sq. This pavement probably belonged to the end of the Larsa period: the earlier pavement occurred no less than 1.6 m. below the upper pavement and contained burnt-bricks measuring 0.27 X 0.175 X 0.07 m. Between these two pavements there was a filling of ash and decayed mud brick, ll loosely packed, and evidently thrown in to effect the re-levelling which occurred when the burnt brick walls were erected over the older mud brick foundations at the end of the Larsa period.

City Wall | CLW,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/9/,City Wall | CLW,,"The meaning of the excavation area abbreviation CLW is not precisely clear. Some references to it state that it is the central portion of the northeastern city wall, thus it might mean Central Long Wall. Field notes with the abbreviation, however, refer to excavation squares along the entirety of the edge of the mound where the outer city wall once stood and thus it more likely to refer to the City Long Wall as a whole.

H.R. Hall dug a 12 meter trench across the city wall in 1919, but Woolley began his investigations of it in February of 1929. In a period of a few days he exposed 100 meters of the length of the wall behind his dig house. In the next season he set his workers to tracing the entirety of the wall, which ran approximately 2.5 miles around the city. To uncover it they simply followed the outer line of the wall to no great depth and made cross cut trenches to assess the width of the wall at intervals. Despite the great extent, the tracing of the wall took only one month. In a report sent from the field in February of 1930, Woolley said, ""...the wall is a complete ruin; not a vestige of the burnt-brick wall proper has been discovered and in few places does more survive than the weathered stump of the huge mud-brick rampart along which the wall originally ran.""

The investigations showed the original wall to be between 25 and 34 meters wide and Woolley estimated that it once stood to a height of 8 meters. On the central portion of the east side, he found and excavated partial houses. Woolley believed that for portions of Ur's history, the backs of these houses formed the defensive wall itself. Many of the objects marked as CLW come from this specific area of houses along the wall, and this is likely the reason that CLW in abbreviation lists is said to be the central portion of the northeast city wall.

The sloping revetment that was often found in CLW squares was evidence of the bank of a canal running along the east side of the city. Some of the CLW squares also contained other excavation areas, such as the North and West harbors, the so-called Kassite Fort, the Rim Sin temple (RS), and the Nin-Ezen Temple (NT).",Central Long Wall; City Long Wall,,,,,

The temple nearest the surface was that built in the Neo-Babylonian period and attributable to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. The excavation area abbreviation NT actually stands for Nebuchadnezzar's temple. No Persian period temple was found here but Persian burials infringed on the building (see area NTB).

Beneath the Neo-Babylonian temple Woolley discovered another, similar temple of the Kassite period. This one seemed to have two phases of construction, one phase attributable to the reign of Kurigalzu. Beneath this sat another temple of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period, also with two phases. One of these dated to the reign of Rim Sin and the other to that of Sin-Iddinam. Yet another temple sat beneath, but this one was very fragmentary and difficult to map. It likely belonged to the Ur III period but little could be discerned.

Inscribed clay cones found in the Larsa levels give the name of the building as E-ni-gi-na and state that Rim-Sin restored this temple dedicated to Nin-gish-zida. Inscriptions in other levels show that this deity was honored here throughout the time periods but that Nin-Ezen (Ningizzida's consort) was also honored here in a kind of double shrine. Woolley suggested that another temple to Nin-Ezen appeared in the temenos area (see area SM) and that Ningizzida was the primary deity for this smaller temple in the southern city.",NT; Nebuchadnezzar's Temple,,,,,

Rim Sin Temple | RS,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/27/,Rim Sin Temple | RS,Enki Temple,"Along the city wall (CLW) in the southeast Woolley came across a relatively large building and spent some time investigating it. Here he found clay cones of Rim-Sin and a foundation deposit mentioning that this king had dedicated the building to the god Enki. Thus Woolley referred to the building as the Enki Temple of Rim-Sin or simply the Rim-Sin Temple. Legrain lists the abbreviation RS but the code does not appear on any field catalogue cards.

Rim-Sin's ninth year is known as 'the year in which he built the temple of En-ki at Ur.' He probably made major restorations rather than founding the building, however, as there is an earlier, Amar-Sin, temple beneath. There are many inscribed bricks of this earlier king, but the early ground plan was mostly destroyed.",Enki Temple of Rim-Sin,,,,,
DP,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/32/,DP,EM Site,"The excavation area abbreviation DP probably stands for Dungi's Palace; Woolley believed the building with bricks marked e-hur-sag (thought to refer to Shulgi's palace) was too small to be what should be a grandiose building. Thus, he explored the area southeast of the giparu extensively looking for it. Most of his abbreviations for excavations in this area refer to the potential palace. When he found cylinders inscribed with the name of Shulgi beneath a partly ruined floor (excavation area abbreviation DT in the northwestern portion of area EH), he thought he might have found it or at least indications of it. This building turned out to be a temple dedicated to Dimtabba (now read Nimintabba) and its very partial remains extended beyond the line of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall to the west. Woolley continued to dig into this western area under a new excavation abbreviation, DP. This area did not reveal a palace or additional ruins of the Nimintabba temple, but instead it showed denuded domestic space related to Hall's Area A excavations. Area DP became the northern portion of area EM, but only partial houses are shown here along what Woolley termed Quality Lane. The houses here were never published in great detail, but many of the DP graves appear on the area EM map as falling along Quality Lane.",DP,,,,,

Dublalmah | LL,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/18/,Dublalmah | LL,E-Dub-Lal-Mah,"First investigated by Taylor in 1853, the dublalmah was originally a gateway onto the eastern corner of the ziggurat terrace. It expanded into a larger building in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. It had multiple functions, religious and administrative, through the centuries. An inscribed door socket of Amar-Sin found here refers to the building as the great storehouse of tablets and the place of judgment. It was thus essentially a law court, possibly with tablets recording judgments stored within. In Mesopotamia, an eastern gateway--in sight of the rising sun--was typically seen as a place of justice, and gateways were often places where witnesses or judges might hear claims.

After the Ur III period the door onto the ziggurat terrace was sealed up and the dublalmah appears to have become a shrine, but it retained its name and probably its law court function. Kurigalzu made significant restorations to the building in the Kassite period and Woolley marveled at the well-constructed fully preserved arched doorway of this Late Bronze Age time. By the Neo-Babylonian period, the structure had essentially merged with the functions of the neighboring giparu.",LL; DM; DLM; LM,EDIII; UrIII; OB; Kassite; NB,,,,,3; 6

EH Site | EH,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1/,EH Site | EH,EH Site,"Area EH is located within the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall south of the giparu. There are many other area designations given to parts of this space (such as DP and LR), but EH overall refers to the interior extent of the SW temenos wall from the south corner almost to the Nebuchadnezzar gate and extending east to the line of Pit F. Walls in the area were scattered and difficult to follow, so Woolley established a grid covering at least 55x100 meters in 5x5 squares. The grid is not well documented but publication shows that Woolley began numbers to the east, increasing to the west, and letters to the south, increasing to the north; square 1,A therefore sits in the SE corner -- 11,T in the NW.

The abbreviation EH stands for E-Hur-sag but the building of that name does not lie within this excavation zone. Woolley did not believe that the building to the east of this area (partially dug by H.R. Hall in 1919) was the e-hur-sag, the palace of Shulgi, despite bricks with the inscription of the building being found there. Instead he called that building Hall's Temple (HT) and sought the palace in many other places inside the temenos. He eventually conceded that HT was indeed the e-hur-sag and published EH without reference to the abbreviation's original meaning.

The area Woolley called EH was the area Hall called the 'tomb mound' because it was relatively high ground in which he found a number of graves. Woolley showed that these were the remains of graves beneath the floors of houses dating from the Isin-Larsa to Kassite periods. EH in this time was likely an extension of the domestic area EM. In the Ur III period there appear to have been larger public buildings here, but their remains were spotty at best. Tablets from this area and area EM show that the residents of the domestic quarter in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period were likely temple workers.",E-Hur-Sag,,,,,,01: 1922-1923

Hall called it Area (or Building) B and he found inscribed bricks in the paved floors of the building which indicated it was the ehursag, the house of the mountain, which was purported to be Shulgi's palace. Woolley, in his first season, found inscribed bricks in the walls that mentioned Ur-Namma's temple of the moon god, and he concluded the building was actually a temple, dubbing the excavation area HT. He believed the actual ehursag palace to be located somewhere else within the temenos. Many of his subsequent excavation abbreviations attest to his search for the building, but he eventually agreed that HT was the ehursag itself.

In his fourth season, Woolley cleared the remaining extents of the building. He had already explored parts of the terrace wall on which it stood and came to find that it was part of the Ur III temenos wall. Along this wall near the ehursag Woolley found a deep well, at the bottom of which (13 meters down) were many inscribed clay cones.",Hall's Temple,,,,,,
EM Site | EM,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/10/,EM Site | EM,EM Site,"The excavation area abbreviation EM stands for Extra-Mural because this area lies outside of the southwest Temenos Wall. H.R. Hall investigated a portion of the high ground at this site (his Area A) in 1919, finding the remains of domestic structures. Taylor had also cut a trench here in 1853. Woolley first tested the ground early in 1926 (season 4) and then dug more completely in season 5, concentrating on about 60x40 meters of space and excavating to a depth of approximately 5 meters from the surface. He dug through Kassite and other late remains that were particularly fragmentary. He reported two Kassite houses (which he dubbed High House and Hill House) that were complete enough to map, and eventually uncovered twelve houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period. There were many graves beneath the floors and tablets were also relatively common. Most of the tablets have to do with the business of the temple, so the houses here probably belonged to temple workers.

Woolley named the streets he found in areas EM and AH. He felt that by naming the streets he could more easily identify any particular house, giving them numbers along the street with odd numbers on one side and even on the other. Many of the street names recur in the English city of Bath, where Woolley owned a house.

The northern portion of area EM ('Quality Lane' on Woolley's map) was excavated as area DP in season 4. This was higher ground than much of the rest of EM and is mapped with only partial houses that are not published in any detail. The houses of EM are more completely published, but their various phases of construction and rebuilding are not detailed. The domestic space represented by these houses likely continued eastward into area EH in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian and Kassite periods, then was cut through and partly destroyed by the foundations of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall.",EM,,,,,,,Domestic

Enunmah | TTB | ES,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4123/,Enunmah | TTB | ES,E-nun-mah,"That its foundation goes back behind the Third Dynasty of Ur is certain, for fragments of walls
and pavements in pIano-convex brick (PI. 30a) prove the fact, but of the character of that original structure nothing can be said. Ur-Nammu was responsible for the temple in its existing form; he built it in mud brick, or at any rate made much use of that material, and his work was added to and probably completed by his son Dungi. Bur-Sin
replaced with burnt brick the mud-brick walls of his grandfather and Gimil-Sin added further details. The temple was
completely overthrown by the Elamites on the occasion of the downfall of Ibi-Sin and under the Isin Dynasty was rebuilt by Gimil-ilishu, who faithfully followed the lines of the Third Dynasty ground-plan. Ishme-Dagan, Nur-Adad,
and Sin-idinnam all in turn undertook repairs of its structure and Kudur-Mabug seems to have done some more radical restoration, but his building was destroyed by the Babylonians in the time of Samsu-iluna. It was probably
restored after a fashion not much later, but the first actual record of its re-establishment is that of Kuri-Galzu; the
Kassite ruler still kept to the original plan, but added a few new features. His building was repaired, without any
noticeable alterations, by Marduk-nadin-ahhe in the 11th century B.C. Nebuchadnezzar was the first to tamper seriously with the ancient ground-plan; his reconstruction involved a complete change of character corresponding to
a change of ritual in the temple services, and in the temple as he left it the old E-nun-mah is barely recognisable. Nabonidus repaired but does not seem to have modified his predecessor's work. Finally we find, above the Nabonidus
level, remains of a further reconstruction which we can attribute only to Cyrus of Persia.; The building was an almost exact square measuring some 57.00 m. in either direction; its angles were, as usual,
orientated to the cardinal points of the compass. It was surrounded by a wall 2.70 m. thick strengthened by double
buttresses, of which there were five on each side, and the area thus enclosed was raised to form a platform about 2.00 m. above the level of the ground outside; this wall is fairly well preserved on the NE (v. Pis. 28b., 29b), has
suffered a good deal, and is partly masked by subsequent additions in the SE (PI. 29a), could be traced only by its
foundations on the SW, where the building has been remodelled, and on the NW it has been completely eradicated by a drain of Nebuchadnezzar. There is a doorway in the SE wall which, however, would seem to have led only into
two small chambers having no communication with the rest of the building. In view of the denudation of the walls,
which here do not rise above floor level, it is not possible to assert definitely that such communication never
existed, but the facts that the wall between rooms 17 and 18 is  whereas in almost every other case the doorways can be distinguished even at this level (rooms 8, 9, and 10 are the sole exceptions), and that no hinge-box or doorsocket stone was found here, make the theory of a door hazardous. Probably the real entrance to the building
was in the NW front.",TTB; TTB.W; TTB.ES; TTB.SS; ES,,,,,,,
ES,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/11/,ES,E-nun-mah,"The abbreviation ES almost certainly stands for Enunmah South, though it may also have to do with the building called emuriana, referenced in a disturbed Kassite door socket found in the area. Legrain lists ES as the Egigpar of Nabonidus, SW end, but he almost certainly meant the Enunmah of Nabonidus. The abbreviation ES first appeared in season one as a supplement to Trial Trench B (TTB.ES) when the trench was expanded to reveal the extents of the building found to be called e-nun-mah. In season 3, the abbreviation shortened simply to ES, used for the majority of the enunmah building.

The Enunmah changed in layout and likely in usage through the many centuries of its existence. Initially a storage building called the ga-nun-mah, it seems to have been used as a temple, the e-nun-mah, in the Neo-Babylonian period.

Some lists of excavation abbreviations equate ES with the Dublalmah site. This is because the southern Enunmah is just east of the Dublalmah. Area ESB is still more closely associated with the eastern edge of the dublalmah.",Enunmah South; Emuriana Site,,,,,,,

TTB,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/41/,TTB,E-nun-mah,"TTB is shorthand for Trial Trench B, one of two trenches excavated in Woolley's first season at Ur in 1922. This one was about 3.5 meters wide by about 60 meters long and ended up almost entirely within the e-nun-mah, a building that went through many forms over the centuries. The trench was expanded to reveal the building and extra abbreviations were added to it to indicate portions, roughly in directional notation from the main trench. The trench cut the building close to the west corner and TTB.W became the abbreviation for this area beyond the trench itself. TTB.SS and TTB.ES covered the larger area to the south and east. The abbreviation ES was then used in later seasons to refer to the majority of the building and a small portion of the area to the south of it.

The enunmah itself was a complicated structure that seems to have changed function from storeroom (originally called the ganunmah) to temple through its long history. Woolley began assigning room numbers within the abbreviation TTB, but these excavation room numbers do not correlate precisely with the published room numbers.",Trial Trench B,,,,,,01: 1922-1923,

Against the western jamb of the door in the NW wall was a doorsocket stone, uninscribed, for the insertion of which the mudbrick wall has been cut back; part of the brick hinge-box remains and the mud floor can be traced running above the bricks of the box, from which fact one can conclude that the socket-stone belongs to the Kassite restoration. The mud floor, flush with the middle of the fourth course of wall bricks, was much destroyed; at the NW end there were traces of a brick pavement above it, for which it may have served as a foundation. There was a brick threshold across the doorway, and against the northern jamb a brick with a hole through it had been used as an impost for the door frame. Tablets found here included one dated in the 7th year of Gungunum of Larsa (U. 318).",Trial Trench B.20,,,,,,,

The floor had disappeared, owing to the fact that the Neo-Babylonian floor had been laid at the same level in this as in the other rooms of the sanctuary. The room had been partly cleared by Taylor and had suffered severely from exposure since then. Under the Neo-Babylonian pavement, against the inner side of the entrance door, there was a doorsocket stone of Marduk-nadin-ahhe. 76 Loose in the lower earth filling there were found a large oval blue paste pendant (U. 8335), an object like a spoon-bowl of white steatite (U. 8336), tablets (U. 534-6), and a crescent-shaped amulet of red pebble (U. 8334).",,,,,,,,
TTB.W,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/990/,TTB.W,TTB W; E-nun-mah Room 22,"Against the NW jamb of the door in the NE wall, enclosed in its hinge-box, was a doorsocket of Gimil-Sin (U. 838, UET 1, 80). In the filling was found a broken mud brick with the stamp of Kudur-Mabug and also in the filling was a very large inscribed stone duck-weight (U. 808). A doorsocket of Kuri-Galzu (U. 950) was not in situ, nor was a fragment of a clay cone of Nur-Adad (U. 335). On a fragmentary vessel of limestone was a dedication by Sin- ... - uballit (U. 873). The tablets were U. 739, 740. To the NW of rooms 23 and 24 all traces of the building had disappeared and a shaft sunk between those rooms and the Nebuchadnezzar drain failed to find even the foundations of walls. Below the level of the drain came hard-packed brick earth, artificially rammed, in which (at depth 2.00 m.) was found a late carnelian cylinder seal (U. 775, UE X, 611), proving that the layer was relatively late. From 2.20 m. to 3.20 m. was sand, and then a floor of grey clay thinly overlaid with white plaster, this connecting with First Dynasty of Ur levels found farther to the west. Below this was mixed soil going down to 3.80 m. and then clean sandy soil to 5.30 m. In the top levels SE of the drain and not disturbed by its construction were found a fragment of an inscribed diorite vessel (U. 874, unintelligible), a fragment of a small inscribed stone macehead (U. 985), and a considerable number of clay tablets (U. 381-86, 389-93, 540, 541, 737, 926-37, 951, 966-68, 979-81, 987) and seal impressions, the former including examples dated to the 3rd year of Gimil-Sin, the 6th year of Gungunum, the 2nd year of Abi-sare, the 22nd year of Sumu-ilum, and to the reign of Samsu-iluna; one seal impression was that of A-ab-ba, son of Enannatum, priest of Nannar, perhaps the Enannatum who built the Gig-Par-Ku in the reign of Gungunum. A certain number of objects were found either against the walls of the building, at a low level, or in the rubbish which overlay its ruins. A roughly made cup of reddish-drab clay with a pierced base (Type IV) seemed to belong to the Kuri-Galzu stratum; stone vase fragments with inscriptions (fragmentary) of Rimush (U. 1167) and Dungi (U. 296) and of an unknown dedicator, an inscribed fragment of a statue in diorite (U. 744), a fragment in dolerite of a wig (?) for application to a statue (U. 176), a shell amulet in the form of a demon's head (U. 233), cylinder seals (U. 167 decayed; U. 234, UE X, No. 217; and U. 790), a plumb-bob (U. 835), seal impressions (e.g, U. 574-84, 3255), and tablets, complete or fragmentary, including examples dated to the 8th year of Bur-Sin and the 2nd year of Abi-sare (U. 373, 724).",,,,,,,,

It was in this area that a door socket of Kurigalzu mentioning a building called the emuriana was found and Woolley attempted to uncover this building here. The socket was not found in its original position, however, and Woolley eventually felt that the emuriana building was never in this location or that it had been completely destroyed. What he found in the area was mostly related to the enunmah or were scattered walls that were very difficult to follow. Indeed, this area of the temenos zone, from the eastern edge of the dublalmah to the northeast wall of the Neobabylonian temenos wall, was badly denuded.

By this, Woolley meant the area in front of (north of) Hall's excavation area B, the building found to be the ehursag. Woolley dug Trial Trench C (TTC) in the southern extent of this denuded area in season 4 and expanded investigations in seasons 9 and 10 in order to complete his understanding of the constructions inside the temenos and especially to find more evidence of the earlier temenos wall.

In a season 9 report early in 1931, Woolley had this to say about what he found in area FH: ""considerable Larsa wall, some Kassite house remains of no particular importance, and a remarkable cistern of burnt bricks and bitumen."" In season 10, he said: ""Having proved that nothing could be recovered in this area to complete the ground-plan of the Temenos I stopped the work.""",Front of Hall's excavation area B,,,,,,,

Legrain lists the context as, ""Pit in front of third dynasty wall"" and one of the field catalog cards says similarly, ""mixed rubbish in the pit in front of the IIIrd Dynasty wall.""

Mostly dedicated to the goddess Nin-gal, Nanna's consort, it was also in various periods the residence of the entu priestess. The abbreviation KP, however, stands for King's Palace because Woolley initially thought this might be the site of Shulgi's palace, the ehursag.

The giparu was a very long-lived building, though it underwent many changes over many centuries. Most striking were the changes in the Neo-Babylonian period when Woolley shows it combining with the dublalmah to the east. He believed that by this point the building was not sufficient to house the Ningal temple and the entu priestess together, and thus the so-called Palace of Belshaltinannar was constructed outside the temenos specifically to house the priestess herself.

At times Woolley refers to the giparu as the Great Ningal Temple, which can be confusing as the Kassite and Neo-Bablyonian Ningal temples had moved onto the ziggurat terrace to the north of the giparu (Area HD). Furthermore, parts of the giparu were excavated under area abbreviations other than KP in season 3 when the full extents of the building were only just coming to light.

Many of the artifact cards that have this context designation mention 'lower rooms' and it is apparent that the southern extension HDB uncovered walls at a lower elevation because they were off of the ziggurat terrace.

Woolley came to realize, however, that it was an enormous courtyard surrounded by rooms, and at times in the excavation it was simply referred to as the Ziggurat Courtyard. The path through the court led to the ziggurat terrace and eventually to the temple atop it. The court was likely a gathering place for special occasions of worship to the moon god (whose name Woolley read Nannar, but which we read today as Nanna). Therefore, Woolley eventually dubbed this space the Great Nannar Courtyard.

Area PD is the large space to the east of the ziggurat terrace, substantially lower in elevation than the base of the ziggurat. It had many floors over many periods. It consisted of a large paved courtyard (some 50 x 75 meters) surrounded by rooms that may have been used for storage. Because of indentations in some of the wall faces, Woolley believed there was once an inset wooden colonnade along some of the walls.",PD,,,,,,,
PS,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4338/,PS,,"The excavation area abbreviation PS probably stood for Palace Stores and refers to the series of magazine-like rooms surrounding the Great Nanna Courtyard. Woolley originally coded the region of the courtyard as PD, standing for Palace of Dungi, since he felt it might have been a palace. The series of rooms surrounding the courtyard may well have been for storage, but Woolley came to realize that the building itself was not a palace. The abbreviation PS appears on several season 3 catalog cards, but no explanation of its meaning occurs anywhere. Legrain lists PR as the magazines around the courtyard, but this was probably a mistyped reference for PS since PR does not appear as an abbreviation on any of Woolley's cards.",PS,,,,,,,

Harbor Temple,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4647/,Harbor Temple,Harbour Temple,"The Harbor Temple had no field abbreviation, probably because HT was already in use and because very few artifacts were found within. Despite being largely empty, this building was described by Woolley as one of the best preserved temples of the Neo-Babylonian period in Mesopotamia. 

The temple covered 33x27 meters and some of the bricks in its walls bore the inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. Nonetheless, Woolley suggested Nabonidus as the more likely founder. The walls were of mud brick with baked brick facing up to a meter thick and they stood to a height of 6.5 meters. The entire building was filled with clean sand and Woolley proposed that it was, in fact, not the actual temple but a complete replica beneath the surface never intended for human use. The actual temple would have stood above and it had completely eroded away. Evidence for the upper temple was found in a few paving bricks of Nabonidus at a level equivalent to the floor of the nearby 'Palace of Belshaltinannar'. In fact, Woolley suggested that the Harbor Temple may have been a chapel specifically associated with this building.

Creating such a substructure has apparent (much earlier) textual but not archaeological precedent. Woolley believed that after the sub-temple was complete, it was consecrated to the gods and then filled with sand, then an entire temple built again above it for human use. No indication of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated was found.

The temple was first uncovered at the end of season 8 and a temporary wooden roof was erected to keep it from filling in during summer sandstorms. So roofed, it appeared remarkably complete and Woolley suggested it be preserved this way for tourists to experience.",Harbour Temple; Nebuchadrezzar Temple outside NE side of Temenos,,,,,,,

Some of these late walls cut into earlier levels of the giparu in its southern portion. The walls were found to be of patchwork domestic structures, two houses (A to the south and B to the north) separated by a street (scanty remains of a House C were also found). They were formed mostly of broken and reused bricks of the Larsa/Old Babylonian period and probably dated to the Kassite period, repaired and reused into the Neo-Babylonian. Beneath these walls were found indications of the earlier Temenos wall and various artifacts of the Early Dynastic period.

The excavation area overall included part of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall to the west, the part that contained the Nebuchadnezzar gate where inscribed bricks of this king were uncovered in foundation boxes. It stretched southward to the edge of the excavation areas called EH and DP.",KPS; King's Palace South,,,,,,,

LT,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4340/,LT,,"The excavation abbreviation LT is recorded on only one artifact from season 3. The abbreviation probably stands for Lower Town or something to that effect since this area is found outside the walls of Ur, about 800 meters southwest of the ziggurat. Woolley sent a crew to excavate here for one day in season 3, uncovering partial remains of a small building, but little else. The building was never published and the only record of it is in a report dated November 15, 1924: ""A small gang were set to test the character of a site lying some nine hundred yards SW of the Ziggurat, in low ground, where Mr. Gadd had remarked large bricks of a type unusual at Ur and possibly of Sargonid date. One day's work sufficed for this spot; a small building was found here, but it had been denuded by weather below floor level, nor was there anything left to indicate its period; the work was therefore abandoned.""",LT,,,,,,,

Mausoleum Site | BC,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/8/,Mausoleum Site | BC,Mausoleum of Dungi; Shulgi Mausoleum; Mausoleum Site,"Woolley called the east corner of the Neo-Babylonian temenos the Bur-Sin Corner (area BC) because he found bricks of Bur-Sin (now read Amar-Sin or Amar-Suen) there in early season explorations.

Area BC is particularly complex because it consists of substantial building in many periods. The largest building was of the Ur III period, and it is this building to which the abbreviation BC typically refers in field notes. It sits at the northeastern edge of the Royal Cemetery. The main Ur III building was 35 x 27m and its southwest wall was preserved two meters in height, while its northeast wall was largely destroyed. Its walls were built with inscribed bricks of Shulgi. The overall layout of the building is much like a courtyard house but on a large scale and with more ritual furnishings. Attached to this building were two annexes, one northwest and the other southeast, built with bricks of Shulgi's son, Amar-Sin (see context AD). Beneath the entire building were three very large vaults. All of them had been plundered in antiquity and only scattered fragments of artifacts and bones were discovered inside. Nonetheless, Woolley believed that these vaults originally held the remains of the Ur III kings. For this reason, area BC is sometimes referred to as the Mausoleum Site.

The building was destroyed by Elamites, according to Woolley, and sometime thereafter houses of the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period were constructed in the area (see House 30). Finally, the Neo-Babylonian Temenos wall was constructed over and through parts of the remains.",Bur-Sin Corner; BC,,,,,,,

In fact, the houses were built almost directly above its remains and it is curious to think that the large and important mausolea would have faded so completely from memory that houses would be built here 100 - 200 years later. Woolley felt that the Elamite destruction had been severe enough to accomplish this.

The southwest wall of the mausolea remained to a height of 2 meters while the northeast wall was substantially ruined and it is this northeastern side that is most heavily built over. Woolley excavated these houses quickly in his effort to uncover the larger Ur III structure and numbered them as one unit, House 30. Later he separated the plans into individual houses, labeled House 30 A-E.

The southwest wall of the mausolea remained to a height of 2 meters while the northeast wall was substantially ruined and it is this northeastern side that is most heavily built over. Woolley excavated these houses quickly in his effort to uncover the larger Ur III structure and numbered them as one unit, House 30. Later he separated the plans into individual houses, labeled House 30 A-E. All were badly denuded and few finds came from them, though typically there were also graves beneath the floors that are better recorded. These and drainpipes often disturbed parts of the ruined mausolea below.",House 30,Old Babylonian,,,,,,Domestic

Neo-Babylonian Housing | NH,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/22/,Neo-Babylonian Housing | NH,Neo-Babylonian Houses,"The excavation area abbreviation NH refers to the better-preserved Neo-Babyloninan Housing immediately southwest of area AH (though at one point Legrain mistakenly listed it as North Harbour). Woolley excavated in area NH for a short time in season 9 and again for an even shorter time (""a few days at the end of the season"" according to field reports) in season 12. He did not dig below the level of Neo-Babylonian housing as his goal was to expose the layout of a portion of the Neo-Babylonian town. Across much of the site, the Neo-Babylonian domestic remains were badly preserved and even here there were only the stubs of walls and some evidence of later, Persian, occupation. The houses used no baked brick and they were close to the surface, thus they had often disappeared almost completely. Nonetheless, Woolley recovered outlines of two streets and seven houses along with a number of late artifacts, including two pots filled with tablets dating from the reign of Nabopolassar up to that of Alexander the Great.

Neo-Babylonian houses were much more spacious in ground plan than Old Babylonian and were typically built with a saw-toothed outer plan that Woolley had difficulty explaining. The streets were much more linear than earlier layouts and this implies developments in centralized town planning. Woolley attributed this entire domestic quarter, which he believed had been built on ground cleared of all other remains, to the time of Nebuchadnezzar.

Despite the fact that there were many artifacts recovered here and there were many graves excavated, there are only four field notecards extant and only cursory publication. When reporting graves, Woolley listed only house number, not room. Even the house numbers were assigned late, as evidenced by publication in UE9, which discusses House A and B while its map numbers 1-7. Houses 6 and 7 were certainly dug in 1931 when Woolley intended to extend area AH, but he changed his mind and only later went back to uncover the outlines of a few more houses south of these in the final season, including House 1, dug in 1934.",NH,,,,,,,

Woolley often used the suffix letter B to indicate an extension of an excavation area, particularly one that went beyond the confines of a visible building he was excavating. He rarely explains, however, just how far away from the building the extended excavation was carried out. In this case, Woolley explored late remains that surrounded the Ningizzida temple, noting that there were Neo-Babylonian and Persian house remains and burials nearby. Most of these are likely from area NTB, though Woolley only preceded the grave number with NT and some late graves did infringe upon the temple building itself.

There are very few artifacts that actually display the NTB designation and these are all from season 8. The excavation area outside the temple space may not have been large, though it is impossible to tell on current evidence.",NTB,,,,,,,

Palace of Bel-Shalti-Nannar | AD ,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4636/,Palace of Bel-Shalti-Nannar | AD,Palace of Bel-Shalti-Nannar,"The excavation area abbreviation AD was apparently duplicated by accident and thus refers to two different areas of the site. At the excavation, the designation was used to refer to a large Neo-Babylonian structure in the northern portion of the site that was eventually dubbed the 'Palace of Bel-Shalti-Nannar.' The horizontal extent of this building is one of the largest at Ur and the layout resembles that of the 'Great House' in Merkes at Babylon. The building's foundations were preserved to a great depth (over 3 meters) and paved floors sat at the top of the intentional fill of these foundations. Walls did not extend much above this level and excavation consisted mostly of following the outlines in order to determine the ground plan. A few artifacts were recovered, primarily from intrusive graves and from foundation deposits.

Inscribed bricks in the preserved floor led Woolley to identify the building with the residence of the entu priestess in the Neo-Babylonian period. It was built for the daughter of Nabonidus, whose name we now read as Ennigaldi-Nanna but which in Woolley's day was read Bel-Shalti-Nannar. It may have had some administrative functions but it mainly appears to have been a large-scale residence.

Legrain, in his museum work on inscribed materials, used the excavation area abbreviation AD to refer to a subsection of area BC (the mausoleum of the Ur III kings). Artifacts from the two separate AD contexts have been divided in the digital data wherever possible.",AD,,,,,,,

Pit F,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/36/,Pit F,Flood Pit; Pit F,"Pit F stands apart from the Royal Cemetery pits dug in the preceding year, despite its letter 'F' falling inside the sequence of those pits. The sequence of pit letters was assigned after most had been dug, probably in season 8 as confusion arose over pits I and J. Pit F was originally called PFT to distinguish it from pits in the Royal Cemetery area. The suffix T probably stood for Temenos to show that Pit F was dug in the area inside the early temenos wall. The abbreviation became confusing and Legrain reports PF as 'Flood Pit' and PFT as 'Shaft in town area,' but the two designations are actually identical.

The term 'Flood Pit' was often used to refer to Pit F because of the deep layers of silt found near its deepest extent. As much as 3 meters thickness of fine water-lain soil was encountered here, evidence of a great flood. In his books and talks for the general public, Woolley often made the equation of this flood with the biblical flood, but in his academic discussions he never did. Instead, here he referred to the frequent flooding of the Euphrates and how this particular flood must have been large and may have spawned Sumerian legends.

Pit F was extremely large and extremely deep. Woolley's intent was to reach the earliest occupation of the site. He chose an already low-lying zone neighboring the excavation area EH and laid out a trench 15x25 meters, though in the southern half he only dug 10 meters width, making the final pit L shaped. He truncated the horizontal extent further as he dug down to avoid collapse and he eventually reached a depth of some 19 meters from the surface of the mound. The top of the pit had already been denuded to the Early Dynastic levels and thus late material was typically not found here. From the surface, Woolley found eight levels of early building remains going deeper and deeper. Beneath this he found pottery kilns and a deep layer of over-fired pottery fragments indicating manufacture. Near the bottom of this stratum he began finding Uruk period graves (that he called Jemdat Nasr period graves). He labeled these not with numbers, but with letters in the sequence PFG/A through PFG/XX. Below this he encountered the flood layer with Ubaid period graves cut into it. Beneath the flood layer he found evidence of Ubaid habitation near sea level and what he believed to be indications of the early marshlands in which Ur had originally been a very low mound.",PFT; Pit F,,,,,,,

Royal Cemetery | PG,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/25/,Royal Cemetery | PG,Royal Cemetery; Great Cemetery,"The excavation area abbreviation PG grew to refer to a large region, at least 60x80 meters, in the southeastern portion of the Neo-Babylonian temenos but below the level of that wall. The area is most often referred to as the Royal Cemetery. The abbreviation PG, however, was initially used to designate individual graves: PG1422, for example, refers to Private Grave number 1422. The first PG numbers were assigned in season 5 when a series of trial trenches (see TTD, TTE, TTF, and TTG) were excavated in the area. These trenches were expanded to uncover more and more graves over the next few seasons. The last number assigned in the PG sequence was around 1850 but numbers were often reassigned for publication and even in the field some numbers were combined as they were recognized to come from one large grave rather than two separate ones. Others were deemed to fragmentary to publish; furthermore, several hundred additional graves were found in Pit X, an expansion of the PG area dug in 1934. The total number of graves excavated in the Royal Cemetery is thus extremely difficult to determine. Woolley reports that there may once have been as many as three times the total number of graves he recorded, as he found many plundered and almost completely destroyed.

Despite being called the Royal Cemetery, there were only 16 graves that Woolley actually dubbed 'royal.' He believed that these formed the core of the burial ground and that many other people wanted to be buried nearby. The cemetery lay outside of the original temenos, the core of the city, and was apparently a dumping ground through much of its history. Stratigraphic layers of sealings (see SIS) help to date the main period of the Royal Cemetery to the Early Dynastic III, though there are also graves of the Akkadian and perhaps some of the early Ur III period here. Well beneath the main PG area are also graves of the Uruk and Ubaid periods, but these were mainly uncovered in pits dug within or adjacent to area PG (see PJ, Pit W, Pit X, Pit Y and Pit Z).

Most burials in area PG were simple inhumations with few artifacts, but the ones Woolley called royal were much more elaborate. Apart from having rich artifacts, they also showed evidence of human sacrifice -- many bodies were found in 'death pits' outside the main 'royal' burial. The people found in these death pits may have been attendants who went into the afterlife with their king or queen, yet no other indication of this practice is found elsewhere in Mesopotamia. Nor do we know who these 'kings and queens' were. The dating of the graves makes it difficult to associate them with a known dynasty at Ur and there were very few names found with any of the bodies. Only the burial of Puabi, the Queen, can be directly identified by her cylinder seal and she does not appear on any king list. References to Mesannepada and his wife Ninbanda, a king and queen of the first dynasty of Ur, were found but not in specific graves. Instead, they were found in material above the main graves and would imply that the royal tombs pre-date the first dynasty.

Woolley spent a great deal of time and energy excavating the Royal Cemetery and the majority of his field notes concern it. Recording of contexts here, then, is better than anywhere else at Ur. Nonetheless, not all of the graves were mapped and photographs were often difficult to obtain.",PG; Private Graves,,,,,,,

Pit A,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4566/,Pit A,Pit A,"Beginning in season 7, Woolley excavated a series of pits within the Royal Cemetery. He had already cut this area down about 10 meters from the surface, so it was an ideal location to go deeper to investigate the earliest occupation of the site. The only map of the location of these pits that Woolley published is found in Ur Excavations volume 4 in 1955, but it is demonstrably unreliable. Combining information from the field notes, the UE4 plan, and the UE4 stratigraphic profile helps to get closer to the actual sizes and locations, but most of these cannot be taken as exact.

Pit A was located relatively centrally in the overall Royal Cemetery Area, though its exact location is not known. A reference in the Antiquaries Journal for 1929 mentions a pit dug somewhat northwest of Pit B on the ""other side of PG/1237"" and this must be Pit A as no other pit would fit the description. This helps to narrow the location as does the fitting of lines from the combined stratigraphic profile published in UE4. Everything points to a location west-nortwest of PG/1237. The plan map published in 1955 shows Pit A substantially southwest of this, but it is not trustworthy. The stratigraphic profile places the width of the pit at 2 meters and it is probably safe to assume that it was square. It began at the same level as the floor of PG/1237 and went down at least another 5 meters, reaching 1.5 meters above sea level.

Pit B was located in the annex to PG/1237, the Great Death Pit. This 'annex' was immediately to the northeast of the pit and is only shown on early maps (Antiquaries Journal for 1929). Woolley believed it was the site of a completely destroyed chamber for the primary burial associated with the death pit. He states that Pit B was not much more than a meter square, but the stratigraphic profile shows it at 2 meters across.

Pit C is said to be in the southeast corner of the Royal Cemetery. The cemetery was expanded through the years, however, and the corner referenced in relation to this pit should be the corner as of its excavation in 1929. The stratigraphic positioning compared to the overall map of the Royal Cemetery allows us to place Pit C with relative confidence, but its horizontal extent is not known as only its northwestern edge appears on the stratigraphic profile.

Pit E was near PG/777 but whether southwest or northeast is not clear. It is likely to have fallen to the southwest as the plan map places it on the western side. It was approximately 3x3 meters and was ""sunk against the face of the wall of the second pre-cemetery series of buildings"" (UE4 p.56). It reached a depth of about 2 meters above sea level.

Pit G was the largest of the pits dug in the Royal Cemetery in season 7 (larger were dug in seasons 11 and 12). It was located northwest of PG/777. The stratigraphic profile shows it as being 10 meters from NW-SE, but an early reference in the Antiquaries Journal for 1929 states that it was laid out as being 14x4 meters. It may have been conceived of as two pits, however, as the same reference mentions one pit on the outer line of a retaining wall [of the early temenos?] and a smaller on the inner line. Together they are later referred to as Pit G, or the smaller one may have been abandoned and only the 10 meter extent of Pit G reported.

The pit was on the northwestern outskirts of the Royal Cemetery and it uncovered some building remains. In fact, walls were not unusual in the Royal Cemetery as witnessed by this quote from UE4, p.70: ""Over a large part of the Cemetery area there extended walls of plano-convex mud bricks, at two distinct levels... All were thin and flimsy, all much destroyed by the diggers of the Cemetery graves."" Woolley felt that these were just store rooms of a temporary nature.

The pits dug in the Royal Cemetery in season 7 were intended to test the lower levels and little if anything was collected from them. Pit G, however, appears to have been a prelude to Pit F and may have initially been conceived of as Pit F in the sequence. Pottery was collected from it and analyzed by Henri Frankfort in Antiquaries Journal volume 9. Initial mentions of the pit indicate it was to go to the lowest levels, but it only reached 7.5 meters above sea level. It also began at a much higher point than other trenches, at 14.5 above sea level. Woolley must have realized he needed a much larger pit to achieve his goals and began that as PFT in the next season. The shift from this pit to the much larger is likely the origin of Legrain's listing of separate PF and PFT contexts, and the beginning of Woolley's realization that he must rename the entire sequence of pits at Ur.",Pit G,,,,,,,

Pit H is probably the smallest of the pits in the Royal Cemetery. It does not appear on the stratigraphic profile but is clearly stated to have been located in the middle of chamber B of PG/779. This is a small chamber measuring only 2x2 meters and the pit therefore must be this size or smaller. Woolley reports reaching 2.5 meters above sea level in the pit, beginning at the level of the chamber only 5.65 meters above sea level. Its relatively small horizontal and vertical extents are almost certainly why it does not appear on the profile drawing. It is also approximately in line with Pit A at the angle of the stratigraphic profile and would thus be difficult to include. Finally, it may actually be that the pit was dug in season 8, though there is no firm indication of this.",Pit H,,,,,,,
Pit W,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1245/,Pit W,Pit W,"Pit W was excavated from the bottom of area PG near Pits Y and Z in order to more fully explore the Seal Impression Strata discovered running across the cemetery. Since these strata contained so many early seals and tablets it was clear that they were essential for dating the graves and for learning more about the administration of the city of Ur. In order to observe the strata more clearly, Pit W was much larger than most exploratory pits in the cemetery region, laid out to be 15x7 meters. It was dug from the northeast side of PG/1631 but its horizontal extents were not mapped. Its published stratigraphic profile shows that PG/1631 was actually somewhere near the middle of the long side of the trench and Woolley states that Pit W was placed so as to virtually fill the gap between Pits Y and Z, but was set a few meters northeast of them. This allows for a relatively accurate placement of the pit. 

Pit W quickly ran through the seal impression strata but Woolley continued it down much farther, as he had with Pits Y and Z, to reach about a meter below sea level. He thus uncovered many graves earlier than the main Royal Cemetery, and because he believed them to be from the Jemdet Nasr period, he began JNG numbers for them. This discovery, combined with early graves in Pit Y, spawned the conception of a Jemdet Nasr cemetery running beneath and south of the Royal Cemetery, and in season 12 Woolley would seek to expose it in Pit X.",Pit W,,,,,,,

Pit Z,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3724/,Pit Z,Pit Z,"In season 8, Woolley expanded the Royal Cemetery (area PG) to the southwest and northeast. After digging more of the southwestern extent, he decided to investigate deeper still in two pits larger than those he dug in season 7 but not as large as Pit F in the Temenos area. These two pits were initially Pits I and J in the sequence but confusion with lettering caused Woolley to begin at the end of the alphabet and rename these pits Y and Z.

Pit I was located northwest of Pit J along the southwestern line of the Royal Cemetery excavation and was quickly renamed Pit Z. There are very few references to Pit I in the field records. Legrain lists PIG as a pit near PFT and the final letter G shows that it was within the Royal Cemetery area rather than the Temenos area. Pit Z is about 50 meters southeast of Pit F. The published stratigraphic profile shows it to be 6 meters wide at the top and 4 meters wide at the bottom. Its sides sloped in order to prevent collapse. It reached just below sea level and it revealed more of the seal impression strata that ran through the cemetery. This pit and Pit Y both uncovered graves earlier than the Royal Cemetery main burials. These graves were eventually given JNG numbers, a continuous sequence across Pits W, X, Y, and Z that collectively came to be considered area PJ. Several, however, were initially given PG numbers and later renumbered in the JNG sequence.",Pit I; Pit Z,,,,,,,

PG/1054,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/944/,PG/1054,PG 1054,"Ur Excavations vol. 2: ""This grave illustrated more fully than any other the ritual of a royal burial; the soil above it was full of later graves the digging of which had destroyed any superstructure that there might have been and the upper part of the tomb-shaft; the tops of the original walls were only encountered at a depth of 4-00 m. below the modern surface. But below this there had been no disturbance and the tomb and its accessories were intact. The excavation was not easy, partly because the virtual disappearance of the south-east wall and the fact that the north-east wall was for a long while not discovered, being hidden under the earth ramp made for our basket-men, prevented us at first from seeing that we were dealing with one definite shaft, and the different stratification on the two sides of the cross-wall, at least in the upper levels, further concealed the truth. The higher part of the shaft sides were never found and are therefore only dotted in on the section. The correlation of field notes written quite independently was not simple, but fortunately there were enough points of contact, and the section, though slightly schematic, does give the facts fairly accurately.""; Woolley believed this royal tomb to show the process of ritual surrounding the burial and building of the grave shaft. The tomb is a complex one, consisting of a deep, walled shaft above a rubble and earth domed tomb. Woolley believed that the burials in the shaft acted as a kind of death pit, thus he believed the bodies in the shaft to be attendants to the primary burial in the domed chamber below.

In the main chamber were the bodies of five people, four men and one woman. The woman was clearly an important person, lying in the center of the tomb and having a gold cylinder seal as well as other high value objects, including much carnelian. The walls of the shaft above began from a layer packed over the domed chamber and in theory could be a different grave entirely. However, Woolley believed he had evidence of a continuous process that included the packing and smoothing of layers above the dome and then the construction of the shaft. In the shaft, at differing levels, were four more burials. Some of these also possessed rather high-end objects and one had nearby a cylinder seal with the name of Meskalamdug, the King. In his section of PG1054, Woolley reconstructed a dome over this grave, but later intrusive burials had destroyed the upper walls and, if it had been there, the upper, smaller dome.",,,,,,,,,Mk

PG/1422,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/950/,PG/1422,PG 1422,"The positive depth of this grave, 9.50 m. below the present surface, is deceptive in that rubbish containing light-coloured bricks apparently of Third Dynasty type were here found at a depth of six metres, and the bottom of the shaft (which could be traced only below this level) was probably only about 3.50 m. below the contemporary ground-surface. 

The bottom of the pit was lined with plano-convex mud bricks which had been concealed by a further lining of mats; so far as could be made out, the weave of the matting was unusual and produced a rectangular panel pattern. At the bottom of the pit, but not quite filling it, was a wooden coffin measuring I.90 m. by 0.80 m. and 0.65 m. deep. The coffin lid was gabled, made of two planks of which one, 0.28 m. wide, was remarkably well preserved-that is, the impression and colour of it left in the soil was remarkably clear, v. PI. 78a; the sides were strengthened with five external stays, 0.06 m. by 0.03 m. thick, one at each corner and the others at intervals of 0.40 m. In
the coffin the body lay with its head to the north-west on its right side in the usual slightly flexed attitude; the skull was completely crushed by fallen earth; the body was that of a man.",,,,,,,,,NS

Private Graves Area | PGA,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3704/,Private Graves Area | PGA,Royal Cemetery,"In season 6, Woolley expanded his trial trenches in area PG opening up a much larger space in the Royal Cemetery proper. The northeastern extents in TTG had been revealing fewer and fewer graves, so he expected many more to the southeast; indeed, he found an increasing density here. He no longer considered this to be trial exploration, but a true excavation area, and thus began to call the space the Private Graves Area, abbreviated PGA. He also began mapping individual graves, establishing at least 4 mapping points from which he took angular measures to pinpoint locations. Unfortunately he never showed where these stakes were placed on any map so we can no longer utilize the recorded angles. 

Cards from this season that bear the abbreviation PGA all concern textual material. Grave goods or other finds were recorded under their individual PG numbers rather than the general PGA abbreviation. It appears that the only material collected in the area but not associated with graves directly were inscribed objects and thus these were the only ones to garner the PGA designation.",PGA,,,,,,,,,
Royal Cemetery | PG1931,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3737/,Royal Cemetery | PG1931,Royal Cemetery,"In season 10 Woolley had completed the Royal Cemetery volume (UE2) but he continued to expand the Royal Cemetery area and find more graves. Continuing the PG numbers would be confusing since they would not be included in the main publication of the cemetery. Thus, he shifted his numbering to reflect the year he was digging. Starting at the end of 1931, when season 10 began, he recorded PG1931 instead of solely PG. However, he had stopped the normal Private Graves sequence around the number 1850 (some PG/18xx graves were renumbered in the PG1931 or PG1932 sequence) and 1931 is easily mistaken for a grave in the normal sequence when it is actually a series of graves. Even more confusing, Woolley often shortened the 1931 number to PG31, which is easily confused for PG/31, a grave in Trial Trench E.

The general abbreviation PG1931 or PG31 refers to the 1931-1932 Royal Cemetery investigation, revisiting the area along the western side of the Mausoleum of the Ur III kings (area BC). Some of these graves are from the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period and are likely associated with House 30. PG1931 graves were therefore often renamed for publication to LG/xx (Larsa Grave). Objects that were collected from the area but not associated with a particular grave were given the generic PG1931 or PG31 abbreviation. Specific graves were given additional numbers in the sequence PG1931/xx or PG31/xx. The highest number noted in this sequence is PG31/32, but most graves did not have objects or were not recorded since very few specific graves are indicated on the catalog cards.",PG1931; PG31,,,,,,,,,

TTA,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/40/,TTA,Royal Cemetery Area,"TTA is shorthand for Trial Trench A, one of two exploratory trenches excavated in Woolley's first season at Ur in 1922. This one was about 3.5 meters wide by about 40 meters long as revealed by an aerial photograph taken at the end of the 1922 season. The trench encountered a few scattered finds of jewelry and materials that led Woolley to suspect they were from a graveyard, but he felt his team of local diggers was not yet ready to excavate such sensitive contexts. Thus, he decided to concentrate on TTB for the first few seasons, according to his various publications. One of the primary reasons for concentrating on TTB initially, however, may have been that Woolley discovered no architecture in TTA but had struck the enunmah building in TTB. 

Woolley returned to TTA in season 5, when he expanded with new trial trenches and eventually opened up the entire area of the Royal Cemetery. No individual graves are reported in TTA and any that might have been encountered did not receive PG numbers. Those in the following trial trenches expanding TTA (TTE, TTF, TTG) did receive these numbers and gave their abbreviation (PG) to the entire Royal Cemetery area.",Trial Trench A,,,,,,,,,

TTD,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/43/,TTD,Royal Cemetery Area,"TTD is shorthand for Trial Trench D, one of two initial trenches dug in season 5 to extend TTA from season 1. Woolley dug TTD and TTE to search for graves in what he believed was a potentially vast cemetery. Neither of these trenches were ever mapped and no aerial photos show them, as by the time of the 1930 RAF photograph the trial trenches had been so extended that most of the Royal Cemetery area had already been exposed. Luckily, Woolley's field records allow us to reconstruct the direction and extents of the trench. He states that it ran from the head (northeast end) of TTA and extended southeastward to the east corner of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall, making it about 65 meters in length. Though he does not tell us its width it is likely that it was about 3.5 meters, the same as the measurable trial trenches A, B, and C.

TTD did not reveal much, but it was only excavated to a depth of around 2 meters. As Woolley reports in the Antiquaries Journal volume 7 page 1: ""The trench to the temenos angle produced no sign of buildings, but for the greater part of its length a floor of beaten mud, lying about 1.75 m. below the present surface, at which level we stopped short."" It had just missed the south corner of the Mausoleum of the Ur III kings, and when area PG was expanded beneath the level of TTD in season 8, many graves were recorded here.",Trial Trench D,,,,,,,,,
TTE,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/44/,TTE,Royal Cemetery Area,"TTE is shorthand for Trial Trench E, one of two initial trenches dug in season 5 to extend TTA from season 1. Woolley dug TTE and TTD at right angles to each other in order to search for graves in what he believed was a potentially vast cemetery. These trenches were never mapped and no aerial photos show them, as by the time of the 1930 photograph the trial trenches had been so extended that most of the Royal Cemetery area was exposed. Fortunately, Woolley's field records allow us to reconstruct its direction and extents. He states that TTE extended southwest to the south gate of the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall. This would make it about 85 meters in length, and though he does not tell us its width it is likely that it was about 3.5 meters, the same as the measurable trial trenches A, B, and C.

Although Woolley reports that he dug ""two long trenches running diagonally across the site from the head of the old trench"" only TTD can actually have begun at the northern end of TTA. TTE extends at a right angle to TTD, but it does so 8 meters from the northeast corner of TTA. In order to place TTE accurately, other information has been used from field notes and publications. These show that TTE struck PG580 but did not completely reveal it. In fact, Woolley began to dig part of PG580 from the side of the trial trench because he had cut through it without recognizing its full importance. He had to leave this particular grave at the end of the season and return to it in season 6. TTE also hit the stone roofing of PG777 but left it intact. PG580 and PG777 were mapped and show the direction and general placement of TTE.

TTE almost immediately began revealing graves, some of them relatively rich in gold jewelry. It is probably for this reason that Woolley did not continue TTD to any great depth but chose instead to focus on TTE. In fact, he later began extending TTE into new trenches along the same line (TTF and TTG). He assigned numbers to each grave as it was uncovered, preceded by the abbreviation PG (Private Grave). The initial sequence, PG1-PG226 were all located within TTE. The sequence then began to share with TTF and eventually with TTG. Unfortunately, none of the first 579 graves were ever mapped within the length of their trial trenches.",Trial trench E,,,,,,,,,

TTF,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/45/,TTF,Royal Cemetery Area,"TTF is shorthand for Trial Trench F, the first extension of TTE. Like the other trenches in the royal cemetery it was never mapped and does not appear on an aerial photograph. The trench was dug on the same lines as TTE, essentially extending its width, and the only report that shows its southern line is a mention of the location of PG513 within it. This grave rested upon the ruined northwest wall of PG777, which means that TTF must have met TTE at PG777, since the roof of that grave was revealed in TTE. TTF therefore extended the width of TTE to the northwest.

The calculated location of TTF crosses over at least the southern end of TTA. This trench had been dug four years prior and had not been overly deep. It would likely have been mostly collapsed by this point, accounting for the somewhat different line of it and the season 5 trenches TTE, TTF, and TTG. While TTE was almost certainly around 3.5 meters in width as had been previous trial trenches, TTF and TTG may have been wider in order to find more graves. The only indication is the 1930 aerial photograph that shows an extent in the northwest portion of the cemetery that may go as far as 17 meters from the northwest edge of TTE. It is by no means certain, but a trench width of 6-7 meters (twice that of TTE) is suggested for each of TTF and TTG.

The first grave to be given a PG number in TTF was PG227. From this point, the sequence of grave numbers is shared between the two trenches, eventually to be supplemented with TTG.",Trial Trench F,,,,,,,,,

TTG,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/46/,TTG,Royal Cemetery Area,"TTG is shorthand for Trial Trench G, the second extension of TTE, actually extending TTF and obliterating TTA. Like the other trenches in the Royal Cemetery it was never mapped and does not appear on an aerial photograph. The trench was dug on the same lines as TTF, essentially extending its width to the northwest. The first grave to be numbered in this trench was PG355, but the sequence from this point up to PG580 is shared among the three trenches. Like TTF, this trench was probably wider than standard trial trenches, though there is no proof of that other than a slight indication on the 1930 aerial photograph. Excavation while the three trenches were open would have resembled a wide stair case, with TTE being the lowest in the southeast, TTF somewhat higher to the northwest, and TTG higher still. By the end of the season, all three trenches had reached at least 5 meters depth, though TTE had reached 9 meters.

The northwest portion of the cemetery did not produce as many graves as the southeast and Woolley extended excavations in the following season over a large area southeast of TTE, beginning with PG580. He also began to map individual graves in the overall area at this point.",Trial Trench G,,,,,,,,,

Pit X,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/26/,Pit X,Pit X,"Pit X was excavated as a large southern extension of the Royal Cemetery area, likely originally conceived as an extension of Pit Y (Pit J) at the southwest corner. Its main purpose was to uncover the earliest burials in the area, the so-called Jemdat Nasr cemetery first encountered in pits Y and Z. Pit X measured approximately 30x15 meters, though it may originally have been laid out to be 35x20. Woolley reports it as a rectangle covering 1000 square meters, but even the largest indication on the plan map and satellite images is at most 700 square meters and not truly rectangular. Nevertheless, it is a very large space that reached sea level some 20 meters below the surface of the mound. In the Antiquaries Journal for 1934 Woolley reports a total of 13,160 cubic meters of dirt having been removed from this pit.

Some minor building remains of the Neo-Babylonian and Kassite periods were found near the surface but most of the area was apparently used as a dumping ground in the Late Bronze Age and later. Woolley knew that the Royal Cemetery area extended to the south of his main area PG but believed he would find few graves of the Akkadian and EDIII period. He discovered more than he expected, but none were overly rich in finds. These graves did not receive PG numbers since the UE2 Royal Cemetery volume had already been published. Instead, they received PJ numbers. The series PJG applied to graves in Pit X Woolley felt to be Akkadian or later and PJB applied to those of the EDIII period. The break between these two sequences came at around 10 meters above sea level. In all, Pit X added some 250 to the more than 1000 burials of these periods that Woolley had already uncovered in area PG.

Beneath the graves of the Royal Cemetery (starting at around 6 meters above sea level) Woolley reached the earlier graves of what he called the Jemdat Nasr cemetery. Graves at this depth were given JNG numbers. In fact, JNG eventually applied to all of the early graves discovered in pits W, X, Y, and Z. Some of those excavated in Y and Z had received PG numbers but they were renumbered for publication in the JNG sequence. Most of these graves actually date to the Early Dynastic I period.

The area near the base of the pit was smaller than that at the top. Only around 400 square meters was exposed near sea level, yet more than 200 early graves were discovered. Although Ubaid period pottery fragments were found, only two Ubaid burials were discovered here. The large area excavation stopped at 2 meters above sea level, but a test pit at the bottom reached down to sea level itself.",Pit X,,,,,,,,,

Pit Y,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1261/,Pit Y,Pit Y,"In season 8, Woolley expanded the Royal Cemetery (area PG) to the southwest and northeast. After digging more of the southwestern extent, he decided to investigate deeper still in two pits larger than those he dug in season 7 but not as large as Pit F in the Temenos area. These two pits were initially Pits I and J in the sequence but confusion with lettering caused Woolley to begin at the end of the alphabet and rename these pits Y and Z.

Pit J was located in the far southwestern corner of the expanded Royal Cemetery of season 8 and was quickly renamed Pit Y. The published stratigraphic profile shows it to be 12 meters wide at the top but within 1 meter of depth it shifted to only 6.5 meters width. At the bottom, where it reached sea level, the pit had been further reduced to 5 meters width, and a smaller segment of 3 meters size was taken another meter down below sea level. This pit and Pit Z both uncovered graves earlier than the Royal Cemetery main burials. These graves were eventually given JNG numbers, a continuous sequence across Pits W, X, Y, and Z that collectively came to be considered area PJ. PJ initially stood for Pit J but the concentration of burials found in this pit (renamed Pit Y) gave rise to the use of the abbreviation PJ for graves in the southern extension of area PG in Pit X. Woolley believed the early graves to come from the Jemdat Nasr period (thus JNG). Note also that some JNG graves initially held PG numbers, especially in the PG/1800 sequence, and were later renumbered.",Pit J; Pit Y,,,,,,,,,

Badly preserved remains of a building were found here, distinct from the giparu. On a tentative reconstruction of the ground plan, Woolley suggests the original structure measured some 35x40 meters. The building remains date to the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period and many small tablets recording business transactions were found within. T.C. Mitchell, editing the UE 7 volume published after Woolley's death, notes that many of these tablets actually date to the reigns of Shulgi and Amar-Sin. According to Woolley, some of the tablets were twisted together as if in the process of being recycled to reuse their clay for new tablets. He also suggests, very tentatively and based only on a few minor and out-of-place bricks, that this building was originally a temple to Nin-Ezen.",SM,,,,,,,,,
Temenos Wall | TW,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/7/,Temenos Wall | TW,Temenos Wall,"The excavation area abbreviation TW stands for Temenos Wall, a wall that surrounded the ziggurat terrace and its extended sacred space in the northern central portion of the city of Ur through much of its history. The wall may have begun in the Early Dynastic period, as Woolley found some indication of what he believed to be its earliest foundation. There was clearly an Ur III period version that ran south of the giparu and then further southeast to encompass the ehursag. This was the general line of the wall through the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian and into the Kassite period, though the Kassites made some changes in the northern portion. Finally, the Neo-Babylonians changed the wall greatly, expanding the area encompassed to the north and south and adding several gateways. The foundations of this later, quite massive, wall often destroyed earlier remains.

Woolley explored parts of the temenos wall in many seasons and frequently used the TW abbreviation for the wall in any of its building periods. Other excavation area abbreviations include parts of the temenos, particularly NCF, PDW and BC. The temenos wall built by Urnamma was 6 meters thick and built of mud brick with a baked brick facing. Most of the baked brick had been removed, probably for later building. The Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus temenos wall had chambers within it and sported six gates into the temenos area. This area was known as e-gish-nu-gal (Woolley read this e-gish-shir-gal). At least one later interpretation  conflates TW with the phrase Town Wall, but the wall surrounding Ur was always referred to as the city wall, (CLW).",TW,,,,,,,,,

Nebuchadnezzar Corner Fort | NCF,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/20/,Nebuchadnezzar Corner Fort | NCF,West Corner Fort,"The excavation area abbreviation NCF refers to the Nebuchadnezzar Corner Fort excavated in seasons 10 and 11. This building was located at the west corner of the temenos where it meets the ziggurat terrace and turns to the south. Publication UE9 refers to this specific structure as the West Corner Fort, built by Nebuchadnezzar at the corner of his temenos wall. An earlier fortification had been uncovered in season 3, which Woolley called the Bastion of Warad Sin. This structure sits at the north corner of the ziggurat terrace, approximately mid-way along the northwest temenos wall and may have functioned as a kind of sally port gate. It was sometimes called the north corner fort in early seasons but artifacts were not catalogued with this abbreviation in those seasons. Any artifacts from the Warad Sin building were likely catalogued instead with the abbreviation PDW. Nebuchadnezzar's Corner Fort may also have been defensive, but it contained in its later phase a large mixing basin filled with bitumen. In the time of Nabonidus it may well have been in use in repairing the ziggurat.

TTC,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/42/,TTC,,"TTC is shorthand for Trial Trench C, a trench dug in season 4 to explore a low-lying part of the temenos zone not yet excavated (later extended as area FH). The trench was never mapped, few artifacts were recorded from it and it does not appear in publication. Locating it relies on the few catalog cards that mention it and on an aerial photo from 1926. Catalog card references mention the ""back of Hall's excavation"" and ""alongside mud brick wall running NE by SW, S of EgigPar and parallel with Temenos wall."" South of the giparu there is no good candidate for the wall mentioned, but south of the ehursag there is and it is likely that egigpar was written when ehursag was intended. Furthermore, the area known as FH shows that the 'Front of Hall's excavation' was north-northwest of this building. Therefore, TTC at the 'back of Hall's excavation' should be south-southeast. The aerial photo shows a trench about 3.5 meters wide and 30 meters long that sits east-southeast of the ehursag and is very likely to be TTC. The only other possible candidate is a trench almost exactly the same size located southwest of the giparu, north of area EM. This trench, however, is mentioned in a season three field report (not given any abbreviation) as an exploration of an area to be dug the following season (area EM). Since that trench was dug in the season before artifacts are recorded as coming from TTC, the only trench that could be TTC is the one near area HT (ehursag).",Trial Trench C,,,,,,,,,

Publication of area XNCF in UE8 discusses the remains of domestic buildings found east of NCF and Warad Sin's Bastion along the temenos wall and the northern extent of the Nanna Courtyard (PD). XNCF as a whole, however, appears to have included the long range of Kassite magazines extending under and somewhat beyond the Neo-Babylonian temenos wall. These were broken into rows A, B, and C, and field catalogue cards referring to XNCF often record one of these letters and a room number in the contextual notes.

Ziggurat Terrace | ZT,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/31/,Ziggurat Terrace | ZT,Ziggurat Terrace,"The excavation area abbreviation ZT stands for Ziggurat Terrace. It was used for any portion of the terrace on which the ziggurat stood, though other more specific abbreviations were also used. For example, the abbreviation PDW refers to the northern side of the terrace, west of the Great Nannar Courtyard (PD), and HD refers to the southern part of the terrace. Early references using the abbreviation ZT refer specifically to excavations along the terrace retaining wall itself. Later references, however, mention specific areas on top the terrace such as the so-called 'boat shrine.' The abbreviation also refers to deep clearing of the terrace fill, particularly on the north side in later excavation seasons, though the abbreviation Zig.31 was most often used for this.

Woolley uncovered large areas of the retaining wall that supported the platform known as the ziggurat terrace. He found that it was decorated with large wall cones. These cones bore an inscription of Urnamma but there is evidence that the terrace in some form existed in the Early Dynastic period as well. The Urnamma retaining wall was slanted to support the terrace, was 1.7 meters high, 34 meters wide, and was decorated with 5-meter-wide buttresses about 4 meters apart. The inscribed cones dedicate the terrace to the moon god, Nanna, and show that it was called e-temen-ni-gur, which translates as, ""house, foundation platform clad in terror.""

PDW,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/3683/,PDW,Ziggurat Terrace,"The excavation area abbreviation PDW derives from the fact that the area lies to the west of the area designated PD, the Great Nanna Courtyard.

The southern terrace was excavated under the abbreviation HD. Some of the finds from either side of the terrace may also be coded ZT. Legrain lists PDW as specifically the deep trench within the Ur-Nammu terrace, but this is almost certainly a reference to PAT, later called Pit K, a pit dug within PDW.

This structure was possibly a defensive gate that led onto the terrace in the Isin-Larsa/Old Babylonian period, expanded somewhat in the Kassite. It had thick walls and a potential sally-port gateway. Other structures uncovered here included the Ur III shrine to Nanna and its Neo-Babylonian counterpart as well as various potential storage rooms. Two deep pits were begun here in season 3 and completed in season 8, see area abbreviations Pit K and Pit L. Much other work was done on the northwest terrace in later seasons, particularly 9 and 10. See excavation area abbreviation NCF.",PDW,,,,,,,,,

Pit K | Ziggurat Pit A | PAT,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/4608/,Pit K | Ziggurat Pit A | PAT,Pit K,"Excavation area abbreviation PAT was also called Ziggurat Pit A. It was expanded and renamed Pit K in season 9. The pit was located within the area of PDW, on top of the northwest portion of the ziggurat terrace and cut down into its filling. Woolley had hoped to find early buildings beneath the terrace but only uncovered fill of broken bricks and Ubaid period pottery. He dug a second pit to the west on the line of the terrace wall (see Pit L). Woolley is unclear on the exact placement of either pit and the only plan published does not correspond well with his notes. In a field report dated Feb. 1, 1931,  he speaks of removing the Neo-Babylonian sanctuary of Nannar and making this the site of his deep pit. This building sat on the northeastern side of the terrace, just north of the ziggurat's central staircase. In publication UE4, however, Woolley states that the pit was located in the center of the northwest portion of the terrace (the plan shows it falling in the UrIII shrine of Nannar). At this point Woolley also states the pit was dug in 1932, but all field records indicate it was dug in January, 1931 (and begun as PAT in 1925).

In the season 9 excavation it is clear that Woolley intended to excavate a deep trench on the terrace that included both PAT and PBT.  He laid out an area measuring some 20x40 meters that included the smaller pits. This excavation uncovered the early and quite dense terrace wall, so Woolley continued as two pits, Pit K and Pit L, falling essentially on either side of it. Pit K was farther southeast and measured 11x20 meters, stepping in to become 9.5 meters at a depth of 7 meters from the surface. It continued down to sea level, about 14 meters below the surface. These measurements are obtained from the stratigraphic profile published in UE4, but it is admittedly difficult to interpret. The only scale on the image is the vertical and this scale appears to have been exaggerated to show the strata while including the entire horizontal extent on the page. When the portion of the ziggurat included on the drawing is scaled to meet its appropriate horizontal, the Pit K profile is shown to be approximately 11 meters NW-SE at the top.

Two season 8 artifacts have the context Ziggurat Pit A (with a note that this was renamed Pit K). Field notes do not indicate excavation of the pit in season 8 and the artifacts are very late in the season 8 sequence. Woolley may have been cleaning out the old pit in preparation for the following season expansion.",PAT; Ziggurat Pit A; Pit K,,,,,,,,,

The pit sat on top of the northwest portion of the ziggurat terrace and cut down into the terrace itself. Woolley is unclear on its exact placement and the only plan published does not correspond well with his notes. In the Antiquaries Journal for 1925, he states only that this pit was dug west of the first (PAT) along the line of the terrace wall and included the find U.2826. This artifact, a shell plaque, carries on its catalog card only the location abbreviation PDW. The pit had to be located northwest of PAT (Pit K), but that pit is also difficult to pinpoint.

This excavation uncovered the early and quite dense terrace wall, so Woolley continued as two pits, Pit K and Pit L, falling essentially on either side of it.

Ziggurat,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/1061/,Ziggurat,Ziggurat,"The ziggurat was a focus of Woolley's work in many seasons. It was covered in millennia of dirt and it took the initial seasons just to clear this away. In the process, many artifacts were discovered but Woolley did not assign a separate excavation area abbreviation other than Zig. and this does not always refer solely to the Ziggurat but also to its immediate surroundings. When Woolley listed Ziggurat or Zig as the context for an artifact, he usually included that it was at the foot, along the south wall, or some other region of the ziggurat itself. In 1931, however, he began using the code Zig.31 to indicate the deep cuts across and in front of the northern terrace that were essentially under the excavation area PDW. Many of the artifacts with the excavation area abbreviation Zig.31 come from the Ubaid period. The terrace was packed with soil gathered from earlier deposits at Ur, and thus the fill itself contained very early remains.

J.G. Taylor first investigated the ziggurat in 1854,R. Campbell Thomson in 1918 and HR Hall in 1919. Hall uncovered the southern portion and dug into the ziggurat itself to retrieve foundation cylinders of Nabonidus. Woolley worked extensively on the ziggurat, stating that there were only three seasons where it was not worked on in some form. In some of these seasons, however, it was really the ziggurat terrace and its buildings that were the main focus.",Zig.,,,,,,,,,

Diqdiqqeh | DQ,http://ur.iaas.upenn.edu/location/34/,Diqdiqqeh | DQ,Diqdiqqeh,"Essentially a suburb of the ancient city, this area is located about 2 km to the northeast of the ziggurat of Ur. The precise extents of Diqdiqqeh were never defined, but Woolley referred to it as the low ground between the main railway line and the branch that went to Nasiriyeh. The train lines no longer run in the same place they did in Woolley's day, but Corona images allow us to recreate their paths. This makes the general boundaries west, south, and east somewhat known but how far it stretched north is not completely clear.

From the first season workers walking across this area picked up surface finds and brought them to Woolley. At that time the location did not have a fixed name in Woolley's mind and thus first season references sometimes say 'near the railway' or 'near Munshid's water engine.' In the second season Woolley decided to investigate more systematically, but after two days of excavation he decided there was not enough remaining architecture to reward further work. Instead, he continued to allow the workers to gather finds over the next ten seasons, and many later catalog cards state ""brought in: Diqdiqqeh""

The finds from Diqdiqqeh indicate that the ancient suburb played a role in manufacturing and perhaps in commerce. Canals seem to have met in the area and boats may have unloaded goods here. Many figurines, tools, moulds and other crafting items are among the finds, suggesting that Diqdiqqeh may have been an industrial area away from the main habitation. The so-called Treasury of Sin-Iddinam was also excavated in this general area in season 5.

In the Antiquaries Journal of January 1925, Woolley described Diqdiqqeh as follows: A mile and a half NE. of the ziggurat, between the main railway line and the Nasiriyah branch, there is a patch of low-lying ground, occasionally cultivated, which the natives call Diqdiqqeh... a happy hunting-ground for treasure-seekers, and I took advantage of this fact to collect from the natives the scattered antiquities which they might bring to light.",Digdiggah; DQ; Railway site,,,,,,01: 1922-1923,,,
